## Abstract

A good understanding of the statistical procedure used to calculate
trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) risk in combined first trimester screening
is a precondition for taking an informed decision on how to proceed
with the screening results. For this purpose we implement the Fetal
Medicine Foundation (FMF) Germany procedure described in
@merz_etal2016.  To allow soon-to-become-parents an insight on what
the procedure does and how sensitive conclusions are to perturbations,
we wrote a small Shiny app as part of the R package `trisomy21risk` to
visualize the results. We hope the tool can be helpful in the
individual decision making process associated with first trimester
screening.

## Introduction

```{r}
one2x <- 486
```

Biostatisticians predominantly analyse samples from populations of
dead and diseased in the hope of substantiating answers to
question aimed at preventing the adverse event in future
individuals. Less common is the personalized $n=1$ case, where -based
on historical data- one has to choose an optimal test sequence or
treatment regime for a specific individual. However, when interpreting
your own laboratory values that is what you have to do - implicitly or
explicitly!

In the case of first trimester
[prenatal testing](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_testing) for
[Down syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_syndrome),
aka. trisomy 21 (T21), parents are at the end of the screening routine
given a piece of paper containing the results of a combined test. This
consists of

- the [nuchal translucency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuchal_scan)
  (NT) measurement (in mm) of the fetus
- concentration of the Pregnancy-associated plasma protein A
  [(PAPP-A)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy-associated_plasma_protein_A)
  and the human chorionic gonadotropin
  [(β-HCG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_chorionic_gonadotropin)
  hormone in the serum of the mother (measured in [miU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_unit)/ml)
- (optional) results for other markers (e.g. ethnicity, maternal
smoking, fetal heart rate, visibility of the nasal bone on the
ultrasound)

From the biomarker values NT, PAPPA-A and β-HCG (and possibly
additional markers) a risk for T21 is calculated and presented as an
odds, say, 1:`r one2x`.  The question for the concerned
soon-to-become-parents is now, whether to proceed with further tests -
for example a DNA based approach in maternal blood plasma, a so called
**non-invasive prenatal test** (NIPT) or, further down the line, an
invasive
[amniotic fluid test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amniocentesis).
Recommendations for when to perform which additional screening steps
exist and are discussed with the supervising gynecologist, but at the
end its your choice as soon-to-become-parents.

The aim of this blog post is to illustrate how we failed to identify
and understand the algorithm used to calculate the risk. As a
consequence, we attempt a transparent and reproducible risk
calculation algorithm based on the procedure described in
@merz_etal2016. To enhance risk communication we wrote an interactive
Shiny app to calculate the risk, perform sensitivity analyses and
graph distributions. Even though we are not experts on prenatal
screening and have no access to any data, we hope such tools can
inspire the experts or even be helpful in the individual decision
making process associated with first trimester screening.


### What is the FMF Algorithm 2012?

The first step in a scientific approach towards the problem is to
understand, how the $y$ in the reported $1:y$ odds was determined. For
this purpose the exemplary result report (in this case from a German
prenatal diagnosis facility) contained a cryptic note to a "FMF
Algorithm 2012". Unfortunately, no further reference to any scientific
article, no link to a website with additional information nor any
separate pamphlet was provided. Nevertheless, the soon-to-be-parents are
assured that "The model for calculating the risk is based on intensive
research work coordinated by the fetal medicine foundation (registered
charity 1037116)". Cranking the google handle we found that there
exists both an UK
[Fetal Medicine Foundation](https://fetalmedicine.org) (FMF), which has the
stated registered charity number, as well as a
[Fetal Medicine Foundation Germany](https://www.fmf-deutschland.info/en/fmf-deutschland/). For
reasons unclear to the outsider these two organizations use
different risk algorithms: FMF-Germany uses a so called DoE-algorithm
(DoE = Degree of extremeness) documented in the @merz_etal2008,
@merz_etal2011 and @merz_etal2016 (open-access) sequence of papers. In
contrast FMF-UK uses software following "The First Trimester Screening
module 2012 algorithm", which uses so called MoMs (multiples of the
median). What this entails we could only find in a
[rogue access software manual](https://doclegend.com/queue/03-guide-for-the-first-trimester-screening-module_5a17d7fbd64ab28f8c88fe0e_pdf?queue_id=5b205c29d64ab23ffc4c2e34):
the document contains a large body of references sketching the different
analysis components - in particular @kagan_etal2008a and
@kagan_etal2008b seem to cover the essentials components of the
algorithm. However, for each component (nuchal translucency, β-HCG,
PAPP-A, nasal bone, ductus venosus, heart rate, ...) further
references are given without it being clear, if or how they enter the
algorithm. As an example, the FMF 2012 algorithm seems to analyze the
NT measurement by a mixture model approach described in
@wright_etal2008 so the original approach in @kagan_etal2008a now
seems obsolete. This might all be scientifically justified, but for an
outsider it is impossible to retrace what is done: Even though we
spent quite some time searching the FMF-UK website, which provides
access to many of the FMF's 957 scientific publications and watched
[videos about the algorithm](http://www.perkinelmer.co.uk/lab-products-and-services/maternal-fetal-health/FMF-risk-algorithm.html),
we could not find a more coherent document on what the FMF 2012
algorithm exactly is. Even the FMF
[on-line risk calculator](https://fetalmedicine.org/research/assess/trisomies)
does not contain a specific reference and seems to implement its own a
variant of the algorithm
([undocumented javascript source code](https://fetalmedicine.org/assets/b302e11a/js/_fmf.min.js?v=14397)).

At this point it is instrumental to recall paragraph V.3.3 in the
[Commission on Genetic Testing](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Kommissionen/GendiagnostikKommission/Richtlinien/RL-VorgeburtlicheRisikoabklaerung.pdf?__blob=publicationFile)'s
guideline for prenatal screening. It demands that the algorithm for
the computation of such risks to be *comprehensible, scientifically
justified and published in a peer review process*. In particular the
guideline stresses that *scientifically justified* means:

<div class = "blackbox"> *Demanded is publication of the entire
algorithm with detailed software specification, which precisely and
comprehensible describes how the risks are calculated.*</div> <p>

With such a strong statement by the guideline about the **transparency**
and **reproducibility** of the algorithm the above hide-and-seek seems
absurd.

Since we at the time of testing (wrongly?) believed that the
FMF-Germany algorithm was the one used in the lab report and its
papers appeared comprehensible enough for a re-implementation, we
decided to scrutinize the FMF-Germany algorithm further in order to
understand the computations. Aim was to understand how components
influenced the calculation, perform a sensitivity analysis and better
understand the uncertainty associated with the reported risk. The FMF
Algorithm 2012 was expected to be similar in style.

## The FMF-Germany Procedure - PRC 3.0

The procedure described in @merz_etal2016 entitled **Prenatal Risk
Calculation** (PRC) uses a classic Bayesian diagnostic approach, where
one computes a posterior odds for the fetus having T21 as

$$
\text{Posterior odds} = \text{Likelihood ratio} \cdot \text{Prior odds}
$$

In the context of T21 first trimester screening, the prior odds is
known to depend on maternal age and gestational age (at the time of
screening) of the fetus. Tables for this can be found in, e.g., Table
4 of @snijders_etal1999, which is shown below in the form of odds
$1:x$ for maternal age gaps of 5 years and selected
[gestational ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age)
(measured in weeks). The gestational weeks relevant for the first
trimester screening are the gestational weeks 10-13. Using a linear
interpolation we obtain values for maternal and gestational age not
covered in the table - see the `trisomy21risk` package code for
details.

```{r}
##Read background risk from Snijders et al. (1999) table.
data("snijders_etal1999_t21")
snijders_etal1999_t21 %>% filter(Age %in% c(20,25,30,35,40,45)) %>%
  rename(`Maternal Age`=Age) %>%
  kable(caption="Table 1: Background risk in matrix form for T21 for maternal age (in years) and gestational age (in weeks) by Snijders et al. (1999).") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = TRUE, position = "center")
```
<p>

From the table we see that the background risk increases with maternal
age and decreases with gestational age. The latter is related to the
fact that a T21 fetus has an increased risk of spontaneous
abortion. One criticism of using the maternal age as background risk
is that age is merely a proxy for processes and complications not well
understood. From a certain maternal age, it is thus almost impossible
to get a test-negative result, even though most babies
born by mothers that age are healthy [@schmidt_etal2007].

The above formula for the posterior odds means that we can compute the
posterior probability for T21 as
$$
\text{Posterior probability} = \left( 1 + \frac{1}{\operatorname{LR}_{joint}} \cdot \frac{1-\text{Prior probability}}{\text{Prior probability}} \right)^{-1}.
$$
The complicated part of the analysis is now to determine the joint
likelihood ratio between the aneuploid pregnancies (i.e. T21
pregnancies) vs. euploid pregnancies (i.e. non-T21
pregnancies) as a
function of the three biomarkers. In some cases additional continuous
or binary markers indicating for example the smoking
status, the visibility of the nasal bone on the ultrasound or the
ductus venosus blood flow (expressed as pulsatility index) are used to
distinguish further. For sake of exposition we use the
presence of a nasal bone on the ultrasound as additional marker.

In @merz_etal2011 and @merz_etal2016 the likelihood ratio between
aneuploid and euploid pregnancies is broken down into individual
components by assuming that the random variables describing the
observed value for the four risk factors are independent given ploidy
(i.e. the T21 status):

$$
\begin{align*}
\operatorname{LR}_{joint} &= \frac{f_{\text{aneu}}(y_{\text{NT}}, y_{\beta\text{-HCG}}, y_{\text{PAPP-A}}, y_{\text{nasal bone}})}{f_{\text{eu}}(y_{\text{NT}}, y_{\beta\text{-HCG}}, y_{\text{PAPP-A}}, y_{\text{nasal bone}})} \\
&=
\left(
  \frac{f_{\text{aneu}, \text{NT}}(y_{\text{NT}})}{f_{\text{eu}, \text{NT}}(y_{\text{NT}})}
\right)
\cdot
\left(
  \frac{f_{\text{aneu}, \beta\text{-HCG}}(y_{\beta\text{-HCG}}}{f_{\text{eu}, \beta\text{-HCG}}(y_{\beta\text{-HCG}})}
\right)
 \cdot
 \left(
  \frac{f_{\text{aneu}, \text{PAPP-A}}(y_{\text{PAPP-A}})}{f_{\text{eu}, \text{PAPP-A}}(y_{\text{PAPP-A}})}
 \right)
  \cdot
\left(
\frac{f_{\text{aneu}, \text{nasal bone}}(y_{\text{nasal bone}})}{f_{\text{eu}, \text{nasal bone}}(y_{\text{nasal bone}})}
\right)\\
&=  \operatorname{LR}_{\text{NT}} \cdot \operatorname{LR}_{\beta\text{-HCG}} \cdot \operatorname{LR}_{\text{PAPP-A}} \cdot \operatorname{LR}_{\text{nasal bone}}
\end{align*}
$$

In the above, the $f$'s denote the respective probability density
functions, which may depend on covariates such as gestational age (at
the time of measuring) or the weight of the mother. In `r paste0("[Appendix 1]({{ site.baseurl }}/",knitr::opts_chunk$get("fig.path"),"fts-appendix.html#appendix1)")`
we look in detail at how the likelihood ratio is computed for the NT
measurement. The procedure is then analogous for the β-HCG and
PAPPA-A markers - one difference is, though, that @merz_etal2016
extends the analysis to allow for these β-HCG and PAPPA serum markers
to be collected at a gestational age 2-3 weeks earlier than the NT
measurement, because the discrimination  is better for these
biochemistry markers at this gestational age. Altogether, if the prior odds is given in the
form $1:x$ then $\operatorname{LR}_{joint}$ is the factor
multiplied onto $x$ to get the posterior odds in the form of
$1:y$. That means that if $\operatorname{LR}_{joint}>1$ then the
marker values are such that the risk for T21 increases.

## R Implementation

The `trisomy21` function in the `trisomy21risk` package performs all
the computations to take one from the prior odds, covariates and
biomarker values to the posterior odds.
```{r, echo=TRUE}
formalArgs(trisomy21risk::trisomy21)
```
In the above `age` (in years) and `weight` (in kg) refer to the
mother, `crl` is the
[crown-rump-length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown-rump_length)
(measured in mm) at the time of the NT measurement and `crlbe` is the
crown-rump-length at the time of the biomarker measurement.  The
`pappa` and `betahCG` concentrations are both measured in
miU/ml. Finally, `background` is the $x$ of the prior odds $1:x$.
The function outputs a named list of which one element is the posterior odds
(in the form of $1:y$).

<div class="framedbox"> Philosophical note: The obtained posterior odds for the
risk from the analysis is technically not really **your individual
risk**, but the proportion in a population of, say, 1000 individuals
with the same (measurable) covariate configuration as your own. As
Bayesians we, however, feel a certain pain towards such a frequentist
interpretation of the probability concept at the end of a Bayesian
analysis. Believing that assumptions and model choice are subjective,
we dare say that the obtained number has become
**[your risk](https://t.co/iekXiiKGn1)** as soon as you have to deal
with the number.</div> <p>

We can now compare our results to, e.g., the 12 randomly selected
patients listed in Tab. 5 of @merz_etal2016. Note that the first patient has
a posterior odds of 1:486, which we used as example patient in the
introduction. Results are compared in two ways:

* using the background risk as specified in the `Background` column by
  the paper and  comparing our result  (Column: `our_Post`) to the $y$
  of the posterior odds stated in the paper (Column: `Post`).
* Manually calculate the background risk using maternal age and
  gestational age by interpolation of the Snijders table (Column:
  `our_Background`) and compare our result (Column: `our_Post_Back`) with the result of the paper (Column: `Post`).

```{r, echo=TRUE}
##Load numbers from Tab. 5 of the paper (contains 12 patients)
tab5 <- read.csv2(file.path(filePath,"merzetal2015-tab5.csv"))

##Compute our own results for each patient
tab5 %<>% rowwise %>% do({
  ##Arguments for the call to the trisomy21 function
  args <- list(age=.$Age, weight=.$Weight, crlbe=gestage2crl(.$CRLBE), crl=gestage2crl(.$CRL), nt=.$NT, pappa=.$PAPP_A, betahCG=.$beta_hCG, nasalbone="Unknown", background=.$Background)

  ##Manually compute the prior odds
  our_Background <- background_risk(age_mother=.$Age, gestage=.$CRL/7)

  ##Call the trisomy function with the two type of background odds
  post <- do.call("trisomy21",args=args)
  post_back <- do.call("trisomy21",args=modifyList(args, list(background=our_Background)))

  ##Return result
  data.frame(., our_Post = post$onetox, our_Background=round(our_Background,digits=0), our_Post_Back=post_back$onetox)
})
```
```{r}
idxCol <- grep("our_", names(tab5))
tab5 %>% kable(caption="Table 2: Table 5 in Merz et al. (2016) annotated with our manually computed results. Note: The gestational ages (CRL and CRLBE) are now suddenly measured in gestation week and not mm.") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = TRUE, position = "center", font_size=14) %>%
  column_spec(column=idxCol[1], background = "lightblue") %>%
  column_spec(column=idxCol[2], background = "lightblue") %>%
  column_spec(column=idxCol[3], background = "lightblue")
```
<p>
Altogether, we observe that the results do not fully agree, but
  are in most cases of the same magnitude. Even when using the same prior
  odds there are still differences, which can be explained by
  the use of different polynomial  $\hat{y}(x)$ forms for NT,
  PAPP-A and β-HCG, because of problems reproducing the results with the
  polynomials stated in @merz_etal2016 - see  `r paste0("[Appendix 2]({{ site.baseurl }}/",knitr::opts_chunk$get("fig.path"),"fts-appendix.html#appendix2)")`.
Furthermore, the interpolation of the background risks from the
  Snijders table (Column: `our_Background`) deviates: Apparently, a different interpolation procedure is used by @merz_etal2016 - we could not find an explicit mentioning of how this part is done.

## Shiny App

For better illustration we have written a small Shiny app in order to
get a better feeling of what the algorithm does, for example, by
performing a sensitivity analysis where one changes one measurement
value slightly. The App is available from:

<center>
[https://hoehle.shinyapps.io/t21app/](https://hoehle.shinyapps.io/t21app/)
</center>
<p>
and can also be ran locally, by installing the [`trisomy21risk`](https://github.com/hoehleatsu/trisomy21risk) package from github:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("hoehleatsu/trisomy21risk")
trisomy21risk::runExample()
```

#### Screenshots

Computing the T21 risk:
<center>
```{r,results='asis',echo=FALSE}
cat(paste0("<img src=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/",knitr::opts_chunk$get("fig.path"),"shinyapp.png\" alt=\"Second screenshot from the Shiny App\"  width=\"85%\">"))
```
</center>

As example: the NT measurement in the ultrasound image is subject to
some measurement error - even the most skilled operator has
difficulties obtaining errors smaller than 0.2 - 0.3 mm. With the app
we can easily investigate how such measurement error influences
the calculated risk. Another aspect to investigate is the influence of
the background risk from maternal age.

Visualizing the likelihood ratios:

```
</center>


## Discussion

With a cut-off of value of 1:150 for the posterior odds, @merz_etal2016 report a
detection rate for T21 of 86.8% and a false positive rate of
3.42%. The 1:150 is also the threshold they suggest for further
invasive action. For posterior odds up to 1:500 the suggestion in
@merz_etal2011 is to perform additional sonographic investigations in
the second trimester.  Nowadays, one would typically perform a NIPT.

Was the algorithm for the computation of the risk detailed and
comprehensive as demanded by the Commission on Genetic Testing? Well,
since we -despite quite some effort- were not able to find a full
description of the FMF 2012 algorithm and, as described in
 `r paste0("[Appendix 2]({{ site.baseurl }}/",knitr::opts_chunk$get("fig.path"),"fts-appendix.html#appendix2)")`,
were not able to reproduce the numbers in @merz_etal2016, we say:
no. As algorithms become more complex and -as for the FMF 2012
algorithm- contain the combined insights of 10+ scientific
papers, transparency starts with a single easy-to-find accessible
document coarsely describing the overall algorithm. The FMF software
manual, which apparently is not accessible to the public, would have
been a start. Even better would be an open-source reference implementation! To this date it remained
unclear how the standard NT, PAPP-A and β-HCG measurements
entered the analysis and if additional components (ethnicity?  smoking
status? nasal bone? heart rate? ductus flow?) entered the risk
calculation. Similarly, publishing a statistical description of the
FMF-Germany algorithm in open-access articles, e.g. such as
@merz_etal2016, is a step in the right direction, however, some of the
equations in the paper were either erroneous or intentionally kept so
vague, the algorithm became impossible to reconstruct. Altogether,
transparency and risk communication for this sensitive
diagnostic procedure should be improved to meet guideline standards.

What do you do with the obtained posterior risk once you have it? This
is indeed a very personal decision, which make the shortcomings of
statistics clear: Statisticians can annotate even the most unlikely
event with a probability of happening, but the probability is rarely
zero, so it's your personal threshold for *likely enough* balanced
against the ethics and personal beliefs of what to do if, which determines your actions...  In this $n=1$ context the
reported risk might merely be a hypothetical number - at most its
rough magnitude is of interest. However, from a system perspective $n$
is much larger, so everything possible should be done such that the
probabilistic forecast is both calibrated and sharp and that the
recipient(s) knows what this number entails.


#### Postscript

Further information about first trimester screening can be obtained
from the [Fetal Medicine Foundation](https://fetalmedicine.org/).  In
particular their
[book](http://www.fetalmedicine.com/fmf/FMF-English.pdf) about the
11-13 weeks scan (available in several languages) is very helpful
[@FMF2004].  As mentioned the FMF-UK offers a web-based
[trisomies risk assessment calculator](https://fetalmedicine.org/research/assess/trisomies).
Similarly, the
[FMF-Germany](https://www.fmf-deutschland.info/en/fmf-deutschland/)
has their own website with information - apparently it is now also
possible to obtain a demo version of their risk calculation software
[PRC 3.0](https://www.fmf-deutschland.info/en/software/).

## Update 2018-07-24

Directly after publishing the post I contacted the German
  [Commission on Genetic Testing (GEKO)](https://www.rki.de/EN/Content/Institute/Committees/GEKO/GEKO_content.html)
  to make them aware of the post and my troubles to determine what the
  algorithm actually does, what information enters and the lack of
  will of the FMF-Germany authors to communicate certain details of
  the algorithm. As a consequence, I asked which steps the commission
  performs to ensure and track the realisation of the guideline's
  demands for "*publication of the entire algorithm with detailed
  software specification*". In their email reply from 2018-07-16 they
  answer^[My email and their answer was in German - the quoted part of the answer is translated to English by me.]:
  "*... The area of responsibility of the GEKO is clearly regulated by
  legal requirements. The implementation of the Gene Diagnostic Act
  (GenDG) or the examination of the guideline's requirements are not
  tasks of the GEKO. The interpretation of the regulatory content of
  the Gene Diagnostic Act as well as the enforcement of the
  requirements of the GEKO guidelines are dealt with by the appropriate
  authorities of the Länder.*" As a consequence of this, their
  recommendation was to address my question to the equivalent of the
  Ministry of Health in my federal state (Berlin). I did this on
  2018-07-16 (awaiting reply), but would be surprised, if the Federal
  State of Berlin has the resources and expertise to look into
  software transparency of national and internationally operating
  software vendors in this field. I doubt this is different for any
  of the 15 other federal states in Germany. I might be wrong and in for a
  surprise, but as a citizen and scientist it seems like the
  guideline's demand for a detailed software specification in order to
  make it transparent and reproducible how the 1:x is calculated is
  nothing else than wishful thinking...

## Update 2019-03-29

After several inquiries about what is done to ensure the algorithmic
transparency of the prenatal diagnostic procedures remained unanswered
by Berlin's
[*Senatsverwaltung für Gesundheit, Pflege und Gleichstellung*](https://www.berlin.de/sen/gpg/),
I decided to formulate a
[freedom of information act](http://gesetze.berlin.de/jportal/?quelle=jlink&query=InfFrG+BE&psml=bsbeprod.psml&max=true&aiz=true)
request, which ensures that the public authority has to answer, typically
within ~4 weeks. A very good interface to formulate such requests in
Germany is
[fragdenstaat.de](https://fragdenstaat.de). The [subsequent
answer](https://fragdenstaat.de/anfrage/vorgeburtliche-risikoabklarung/)
(in German) shows that no measures are performed in Berlin to ensure the requested
algorithmic transparency. My conclusion: The current setup of
a) recommendations being in the hand of the GEKO while b) compliance
assurance being in the hand of 16 federal states results in the
software providers not being under any pressure to provide algorithmic
transparency. This is rather frustrating for an
ethical sensitive issue such as prenatal screening.
