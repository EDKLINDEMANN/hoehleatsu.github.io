## Abstract

Data on the names of all newborn babies in Berlin 2016 are used to
illustrate how a scientific treatment of chance could enhance rank
statements in, e.g., **onomastics** investigations. For this purpose,
we first identify different stages of the naming-your-baby process,
which are influenced by chance. Second, we compute confidence
intervals for the ranks based on a bootstrap procedure reflecting the
above chance elements. This leads to an alternative league table based
on what we will call **uncertainty corrected ranks**. From an R
perspective we use the problem as a practice session for wrangling
data `dplyr`-style (code available by clicking on the github logo in
the license below).

## Introduction

What's the most popular first name given to newborn boys and girls?
This question seems to fascinate at different levels of temporal and
spatial aggregation, because the choice of names and its dynamics
reflects cultural and social behavior. The branch of science related
to the study of names is entitled
[**onomastics**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onomastics). Mathematical
modelling is used in onomastics to study name dynamics by evolutionary
models and models for contagious phenomena
[@kahn_bentley2003; @kessler_etal2012]. But even the task of
[naming your baby]((http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/12/how-to-name-baby.html))
has almost onomastics optimizing flavour requiring data science
skills. However, once the Official Social Security Administration has
released the numbers for all names of newborns in a given year,
finding the most popular baby name appears a simple counting and
ranking job: for example the
[most popular US baby names in 2015 were Emma (girls) and Noah (boys)](http://www.babynamewizard.com/the-top-1000-baby-names-of-2015-united-states-of-america).

**Statistics** is the scientific study of chance. One fundamental
concept is the inference of a **population** quantity from observing
the quantity in a **sample** (=subset) of this population. To make
this specific for the baby names: In Germany there is no official
first name statistics, as a consequence, the site
[www.beliebte-vornamen.de](http://www.beliebte-vornamen.de) uses
information from a sample of 196,158 kids (corresponding to 26% of all
newborns in Germany 2016) originating from a selection of registrar's
offices and birth clinics to determine the most popular first name in
Germany 2016. However, the aspect of uncertainty in the resulting
ranking, due to only measuring a sample of the population, is
ignored when reporting the
[2016 league table](http://www.beliebte-vornamen.de/jahrgang/j2016). The
aspect of uncertainty can, however, also be more subtle. As an
example, the city of Berlin recently released the official
[2016 first name statistic](https://daten.berlin.de/datensaetze/liste-der-h%C3%A4ufigen-vornamen-2014)
of **all newborns** in the city [@opendataberlinNames2016]. The data are available at
[district level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boroughs_and_neighborhoods_of_Berlin),
which is helpful, because there are notable socio-economic and cultural
differences between the districts. One could argue that since the data
cover the **entire population of interest** (i.e. newborns in Berlin
2016) the use of **inferential statistics** is superfluous.  But is it
that simple?

In what follows we use the Berlin newborn names to illustrate how a
scientific treatment of **chance** could enhance rank statements in
general and in name rank tables in particular.


## Descriptive Data Analysis

```{r,echo=FALSE, results='hide', message=FALSE}
##Read aggregated data
library(readr)
year <- 2016
distrNames <- read_csv(file=file.path(filePath,paste0("berlin-firstnames-",year,".csv"))) %>% select(-strata)
distrNames <- distrNames %>% mutate(district = factor(district), sex=factor(sex))


##How many in total (per gender)
nKids <- distrNames %>% group_by(sex) %>% summarise(n=sum(count))
n_sex <- structure(nKids %$% n, names=nKids %$% as.character(sex))
```

Altogether, the `distrNames` variable contains the information about
the frequency of `r distrNames %>% distinct(firstname) %>% nrow`
unique first names. Below is shown the first 10 lines of the data.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
DT::datatable(head(distrNames, n=10))
```

By summing the `count` column it becomes clear that in total,
`r sum(n_sex)` names were registered in Berlin `r year` (`r n_sex["m"]`
boys and `r n_sex["f"]`) girls. The proportion of boy names is
`r sprintf("%.1f%%",n_sex["m"]/sum(n_sex)*100)`. One caveat with the
Berlin name statistic is that, if a child is given several first names, each name is
counted once in the statistic. Hence, the above total sum is actually higher than the number of kids born 2016 (38,030 in 2015, official 2016 number not available yet).
Despite of the
potential problems with multiple names per kids, the empirical boy
fraction in the data is close
to reported ratios of the number of born boys vs. girls of
`r (sex_ratio=1.05)` [@jacobsen1999], which means that the expected fraction of
boys among the newborns should be approximately
`r sprintf("%.1f%%",100*sex_ratio/(1+sex_ratio))`.

Strangely enough,
`r distrNames %>% filter(is.na(firstname)) %>% ungroup %>% summarise(n=sum(count)) %>% as.numeric`
babies seem to have an empty first name (but the sex is known). We decided to
keep these `NA` names in the analysis, because at the time of writing
it was unclear, if this is a data recording problem (e.g. a delay of the
December 2016 kids) or actually allowed. An email inquiry with the data
providing agency revealed that an empty name is the result of the naming authority [declining a chosen first name](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.berliner-zeitung.de%2Feltern-wollen-seit-einem-jahr-ihre-tochter-jona-nennen--doch-das-standesamt-lehnt-den-namen-ab-baby-namenlos-16740670&edit-text=) in the
interest of the kid. In this case the baby remains nameless on the birth
certificate until the dispute is resolved before court.

We can now look at the top-5-names in Berlin for each gender:

```{r}
##Aggregate data over district and sort according to rank within gender
newborn <- distrNames %>% group_by(firstname, sex) %>%
  summarise(count=sum(count)) %>%
  arrange(desc(count)) %>% group_by(sex) %>%
  mutate(rank=rank(-count,ties="min"))
```

```{r,echo=FALSE}
##Show top-5 results for each gender
newborn %>% do({head(.,n=5)})
```

The top-1 names per gender and district from `distrNames` can easily
be computed in similar fashion using `group_by` and `summarise`
operations. To spice up the visualization we use a custom made
**wordmapcloud**, which overlays the top-1 names over an alpha-channeled
wordcloud of the district's name with font size proportional to frequency.
In the resulting plot we see little geographical variation in the top-1
names over the districts - particularly for girls.

```{r, WORDMAPCLOUD, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=6,fig.height=6,dpi=100, message=FALSE, results='hide',cache=TRUE}
##Make an SpatialPolygon object containing the Bezirke

map <- readOGR(dsn=file.path(filePath,"RBS_OD_LOR_2015_12/"),layer="RBS_OD_LOR_2015_12")
distrMap <- gUnaryUnion(map, id=as(map,"data.frame")$BEZNAME)
loc <- coordinates(distrMap)
rownames(loc) <- tolower(rownames(loc))

pal = RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(9, "BuGn")
pal <- pal[-(1:4)]
pal <- paste0(pal,"1A")

par(mar=c(0,0,4.1,0))
plot(distrMap,border=rgb(0.8,0.8,0.8))
for (distr in tolower(names(distrMap))) {
  theDistrNames <- distrNames %>% filter(district==distr)
  theDistr <- distrMap[tolower(names(distrMap)) == distr,]
  mywordcloud(words=theDistrNames$firstname, freq=theDistrNames$count,scale=c(2,1),random.order=FALSE,colors = pal,offset=loc[distr,],use.r.layout=FALSE, bbox=bbox(theDistr),min.freq=5)
}

  topMale    <- theDistrNames %>% filter(sex == "m") %>% head(n=1)
  topFemale  <- theDistrNames %>% filter(sex == "f") %>% head(n=1)
  text(loc[distr,1],loc[distr,2],topMale %$% firstname, col=palette["m"],pos=1,offset=0.3,font=1)
  text(loc[distr,1],loc[distr,2],topFemale %$% firstname, col=palette["f"],pos=3,offset=0.3,font=1)
}

title(paste0("Most common first name for newborns in\n Berlin ",year," (female/male for each district)"))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
require(ineq)
gini <- newborn %>% group_by(sex) %>% summarise(gini=Gini(count))
gini_sex <- structure(gini %$% gini, names=gini %$% as.character(sex))
```


The [Gini index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient)
for the name frequency is calculated using the `ineq` package and is
`r sprintf("%.3f",gini_sex["f"])` and
`r sprintf("%.3f",gini_sex["m"])` for girls and boys, respectively.  This
means that the occurrence of names in boys is dominated
by fewer names for boys than for girls. Furthermore, both gender's name distribution
tend to be dominated by few names. This feature can also be
visualized by a Lorenz curve - here shown separately for each sex:

```{r, LORENZCURVE, echo=FALSE}
##Make a lorenz curve
newborn %>% filter(sex=="f") %$% count %>% Lc %>%
  plot(col=palette["f"],lwd=2,xlab="Cumulative share of baby names with considered sex", ylab="Cumulative share of all babies of that sex")
newborn %>% filter(sex=="m") %$% count %>% Lc %>%
  lines(col=palette["m"],lwd=2)
legend(x="topleft",c("Girls","Boys"),col=palette,lwd=2)

##Compute a quantile manually
topX <- 50
newborn_f <- newborn %>% filter(sex=="f") %>% mutate(topX = row_number() <= topX) %>% group_by(topX) %>% summarise(count=sum(count))
topXshare <- (newborn_f %$% count / colSums(newborn_f)["count"] )[2]
```

From the curve one can for example deduce that the frequency of the top-`r topX` girl names
(top
`r sprintf("%.1f%%",(topX/nrow(newborn %>% filter(sex=="f")))*100)`
out of the
`r nrow(newborn %>% filter(sex=="f"))` girl names),
cover
`r sprintf("%.1f%%",topXshare*100)` of all
`r sum(newborn %>% filter(sex=="f") %$% count)`
girl namings.

## Analysing Stochasticity in the Name Selection

At which places is stochasticity a useful concept for abstracting
unobservable factors influencing the name selection? We shall focus on
5 stages:

1. the number of babies born in Berlin in 2016

2. the gender of a given born baby; as mentioned above the odds for the
kid being a boy is roughly `r sex_ratio`:1.

2. the number of names given to a baby of a specific sex

4. the selection of the name(s) given that the gender of the baby is known

5. reporting problems leading to the wrong name(s) being recorded

We will ignore uncertainty from stages 1, 3 and 5 and, hence, only
focus on uncertainty arising from stages 2 and 4. One may ask in stage
4, if the naming is not deterministic, once the parents know the sex of
their baby? In this post we take the position that *even* given sex
the naming is the outcome of a stochastic process. The selection
probabilities are likely to vary from couple to couple based on
complex interactions between, e.g., social status, existing names in
the family as well as past exposure and associations with names. Since
data are never going to be available on these individual factors,
we will, as a proxy, assume that the drawing probabilities are
district specific. As a result, the selected name can be considered as
one realization of the multinomial distribution with the underlying
true popularity of all possible names in the district acting as selection
probabilities.

### Uncertainty Assessment using the Bootstrap

When combining the above stages 3 and 4, the name selection process
can be mimicked by a **simple bootstrap** procedure **stratified by
district** [@davison_hinkley1997].  In spirit, this approach
corresponds to the bootstrap approach to ranks used in Sect. 5.3 of
@goldstein_spiegelhalter1996. We operationalise this in R using the
`boot` package, the work-horse will be the function `name_ranks` shown
below.

```{r}
######################################################################
## Compute rank of name within female and male population,
## respectively for a draw of all kids (one kid per row) with
## replacement.
##
## Parameters:
##  x - the full data, one row per kid
##  idx - vector of length nrow(x) containing a possible permutation
##        (with replacement)
##  returns - which column to return, "rank" or "count" (for use in boot).
##            If returns=="dplyr::everything()", then entire frame is returned (useful for
##            use with broom)
##
## Returns:
##  vector or data.frame with stratified ranks (arranged by (firstname, sex))
######################################################################

name_ranks <- function(x,  idx=seq_len(nrow(x)), returns=c("rank","count","dplyr::everything()")) {
  ##Make resampled data and append all_strata to ensure each firstname-sex combination occurs
  x_boot <- x %>% slice(idx) %>% bind_rows(all_strata)

  ##Summarise the number of occurrences for each firstname-sex strata and compute the ranks.
  aggrx_wranks <- x_boot %>%  group_by(firstname,sex) %>%
    summarise(count = sum(count)) %>%
    group_by(sex) %>%
    mutate(rank=rank(-count, ties.method="min")) %>%
    arrange(firstname, sex) #important to ensure order.

  ##Select relevant columns
  res <- aggrx_wranks %>% ungroup() %>% select_(returns)

  ##Return as vector (needed for boot pkg) or data.frame (needed from broom)
  if (returns[1] %in% c("rank","count")) return(res %>% .[[1]]) else return(res)
}
```

In the above, `all_strata` is a
`data.frame` containing all possible strata of gender and
firstname. This is done in order to ensure that we later get a zero
count for names, even if they do not appear in the bootstrap re-sample.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
all_strata <- distrNames %>% distinct(firstname, sex, .keep_all=TRUE) %>%
  mutate(count=0)
```

We then convert the aggregated data to long format where each kid is
represented by one row. This is the most didactic way to explain
what is going on in the bootstrap, but an aggregated multinomial
approach would probably be faster in terms of execution time.
```{r, warning=FALSE}
kids <- distrNames %>% slice(rep(seq_len(nrow(distrNames)), times=distrNames %$% count)) %>% mutate(count=1)
```

Ready to perform the bootstrap stratified within
districts? Yes, its conveniently done using the `boot`
package (which is easily paralleled too).

```{r, BOOTSTRAP, cache=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
set.seed(123) ##fix seed for reproducibility
b <- boot::boot(kids, statistic=name_ranks, R=999, strata=kids$district, parallel="multicore",ncpus=3)
```
We use the percentile method on the `r b$R` + 1 bootstrap rank-vectors
as a method for computing a 90% confidence interval for the rank of
each name for boys and girls, respectively.
```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE }
##Percentile based 95% CI for the ranks.
rankci <- t(apply(cbind(b$t0, t(b$t)),1,quantile, prob=c(0.05,0.95),type=3))

###Combine into a result data.frame.
newborn_ranks <- data.frame(newborn %>% arrange(firstname,sex) %>% select(firstname,sex),
                            rank=name_ranks(kids),
                            rankci=rankci) %>% tbl_df %>% group_by(sex)
##Show result
##newborn_ranks %>% arrange(rank) %>% filter( rank <= 5)
```

**Update 2017-02-07**: [Maëlle](http://www.masalmon.eu/) made me
[aware](https://twitter.com/ma_salmon/status/828505021666967552) of
some newer ways to perform the bootstrap, e.g., using the `broom`
package. It's especially useful for the parametric bootstrap, but by
joining with the previously calculated observed ranks, the code for
making a simple bootstrap stratified bootstrap actually looks quite
nice (although not parallized and hence slower):

```{r, BOOTSTRAPBROOM, cache=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
require(broom)
b_broom <- kids %>% group_by(district) %>% bootstrap(m=999, by_group=TRUE) %>%
  do({ name_ranks(.,returns="dplyr::everything()") }) %>%
  group_by(sex,firstname) %>%
  summarise("rankci.5."=quantile(rank, 0.05,type=3),"rankci.95."=quantile(rank, 0.95,type=3))

newborn_ranks <- newborn %>% inner_join(b_broom,by=c("firstname","sex")) %>% arrange(rank,sex)
```
```{r,echo=FALSE}
newborn_ranks %>% arrange(rank) %>% filter( rank <= 5)
```

Using the lower limit of the 90% CI to group the names, we define the
concept of a **uncertainty corrected** rank (ucrank). This is just the lowest
rank which we, given the modelled stochasticity, cannot be ruled out
(at the 5% lvl. of significance).
Listing the top-5 of these corrected ranks leads to the following
tables for girls and boys, respectively:

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results="asis"}
##Group according to lower CI
nb_rankswunc <- newborn_ranks %>% group_by(sex, rankci.5.) %>% do( {
  data.frame(uc_rank=.$rankci.5.[1], fnames=paste(.$firstname, collapse=", "),sex=.$sex[1])
}) %>% group_by(sex) %>% select(uc_rank, fnames) %>% rename("ucrank"=uc_rank, "first names"=fnames)

nb <- nb_rankswunc %>% do({head(.,n=5)})
#knitr::kable(nb %>% ungroup %>% filter(sex=="f") %>% select(-sex))
##knitr::kable(nb %>% ungroup %>% filter(sex=="m") %>% select(-sex))
```

<center>
```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results="asis"}
tab <- xtable(bind_cols(nb %>% ungroup %>% filter(sex=="f") %>% select(-sex) %>%
                        rename("first names (girls)"=`first names`, "ucrank (among girls)"=ucrank),
                        nb %>% ungroup %>% filter(sex=="m") %>% select(-sex) %>%
                        rename("first names (boys)"=`first names`,"ucrank (among boys)"=ucrank)))
align(tab)[c(2:4)] <- "c"
print(tab,include.rownames=FALSE,type="html", html.table.attributes="border=5, padding=10, style=\"width=100%\"")
```
</center>
<p>

Instead of using the uncertainty corrected ranks, we could instead
have visualized the 90% rank confidence intervals instead (dots denote the
observed ranks):

```{r, RANKCIPLOT, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=4, dpi=150}
top5 <- newborn_ranks %>% group_by(sex) %>% arrange(sex,rank) %>% filter(row_number() <=5)
p <- ggplot(top5 , aes(x=firstname,y=rank,color=sex)) + geom_point() + ylim(c(1,max(top5$rankci.95.))) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = rankci.5.,ymax = rankci.95.))
p + facet_wrap(~ sex, scales="free_x") +  theme(legend.position="none") +  scale_colour_manual(values=palette) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(1, max(top5$rankci.95.), 1), expand = c(0, 0.25))
```


## Discussion

In this post we have used the bootstrap method as a way to assess
uncertainty in ranks. This approach is very general and can be
extended to areas beyond onomastics. No matter the area of application
the approach requires a careful identification of the elements of
chance you want to take into account. In the particular application we
decided to ignore specific uncertainty aspects (e.g. number of babies
born) to not impose further hard-to-verify assumptions. However, as
soon as there is uncertainty, ranks are known to be subject to large
variation. Hence, a different reporting or visualization of the ranks
than the point estimator from the sample is necessary. The use of
*uncertainty corrected* ranks is not revolutionary, but it underlines
the importance of uncertainty in the construction of league tables. A
more uncertainty enhancing presentation of ranks in, e.g., data
journalism, is therefore needed.
