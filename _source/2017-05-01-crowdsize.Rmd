## Abstract

Inspired by the recent **March For Science** we look into methods for
the statistical estimation of the number of people participating in a
demonstration organized as a march.  In particular, we provided R code
to reproduce the **two on-the-spot counting method** analysis of
@yip_etal2010 for the data of the July 1 March in Hong Kong 2006.

## Introduction

Exercising your constitutional and democratic right to express support
for a cause by demonstration has found renewed usage.  The
[March for Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_for_Science)
or the
[People's Climate March](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Climate_March_(2017))
are just recent examples of such demonstrations in the form of Marches
inspired by recent political developments. The number of persons
participating in such marches is *the* indicator by which the support
of the cause is measured. Hence, crowd size estimates have always been
subject to political interpretation and, hence, possible politically
motivated bias. In this work we focus on what statistics has to offer
with respect to finding the **true number** of participants. A good
overview of the challenges here is given in @watson_yip2011.
The estimation of crowd size for moving crowds is a particular
challenge here.

As case study we replicate the analysis of @yip_etal2010 on estimating
the number of participants in the
[1st of July Marches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_1_July_marches#2006)
in Hong Kong. These series of demonstrations which since the handover
to China in 1997 have been a yearly event to demonstrate for democracy
and freedom of speech. Below is shown the 3.6 km long demonstration
route from
[Victoria Park](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Park_(Hongkong))
to Government Headquarters for the 2006 demonstration as described by
@yip_etal2010. A
[youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WQ2TAEquxM) of the
2006 demonstration illustrates this better than by words.

<center>
```{r,results='asis',echo=FALSE}
cat(paste0("![Route of the 1st of July 2006 demonstration in Hong Kong. The two points A and B indicate the location of the two counting points. Courtesy goes to Open Street Map.]({{ site.baseurl }}/",knitr::opts_chunk$get("fig.path"),"Route.png"),")")
```
</center>
<p>

In order to estimate the number of participants a two on-the-spot
counting method was devised by @yip_etal2010: Two points along the
march were selected as shown in the figure: Point A denotes the
location after which an individual is counted as being part of the
march. In order to take into account that people join the march at a
later point than A, a second point B is selected to adjust the count
in A for such late entries. Three to four persons were stationed at
each of the two points. Once the demonstration passed the respective
point each of them started to count the number of people passing in a
one-minute intervals. They counted for one minute every 5 minutes
until the last person of the march had passed the counting point.

### Loading the Data

We store the resulting counting data displayed in Table 2 and Table 3 of
@yip_etal2010 as two Excel-Files. These are then in a data
pre-processing step read and combined into one dataframe containing
the columns `Y1`-`Y4`. Furthermore, we re-format the table's time
specification to proper POSIX formatted date-times. The exact data
dancing steps can be found in the accompanying
[Rmd code of this post](https://github.com/hoehleatsu/hoehleatsu.github.io/blob/master/_source/2017-05-01-crowdsize.Rmd). Altogether, this
yields a `tbl` with the first couple of lines looking as follows:

```{r, message=FALSE}
##Read data
pA <- readxl::read_excel(path=file.path(filePath,"pointA.xlsx")) %>% mutate(Point="A")
pB <- readxl::read_excel(path=file.path(filePath,"pointB.xlsx")) %>% mutate(Point="B", Y4=NA)

##Join into one data frame and make time into POSIX
counts <- rbind(pA, pB) %>% mutate(Time_POSIX= as.POSIXct(paste0("2006-07-01 ",Time,":00"),tz="Hongkong") + 12*3600)
counts %>% select(-Time) %>% head
```

We then compute a number of row-wise statistics for all columns
containing the counts. Which columns contain the counts is specified by a
regular expression `ccol_regexp`, which in our case would be `"^Y[0-9]+"`.

```{r}
##Regular expression for specification of the column names containing the counts
ccol_regexp <- "^Y[0-9]+"

##Note: matrixStats package function (e.g. rowVars) requires a matrix
counts <- counts %>% mutate(Mean = rowMeans(select(., matches(ccol_regexp)), na.rm = TRUE),
                            hatVarY = matrixStats::rowVars(as.matrix(select(., matches(ccol_regexp))), na.rm = TRUE))

##Convert to long format for ggplot visualization
counts_long <- tidyr::gather(counts %>% select(Time_POSIX, matches(ccol_regexp),Point), Where, Counts, -Time_POSIX, -Point)
```

### Descriptive Statistics

```{r, warning=FALSE}
point_summary <- function(counts, thePoint) {
  summary <- counts_long %>% filter(Point == thePoint,!is.na(Counts)) %>%
    summarise(n_counters=n_distinct(Where), n_timepoints=n_distinct(Time_POSIX))

  total <- counts_long %>% filter(Point == thePoint) %>% group_by(Time_POSIX) %>%
    summarise(Mean=mean(Counts,na.rm=TRUE)) %>% summarise(sum_of_the_mean_counts=sum(Mean))

  bind_cols(data.frame(Point=thePoint),summary,total)
}

s <- purrr::map_df(c("A","B"), function(Point) point_summary(counts,Point))
```

The counts of the `r s %>% filter(Point == "A") %$% n_counters`
counters at point A and the `r s %>% filter(Point == "B") %$%
n_counters` counters at point B can easily be summarised in the
following small table:

<center>
```{r}
knitr::kable(s)
```
</center>

A time series for the individual counts as well as their mean is shown
below. One observes that at point B the intensity of the crowd was
lower, as the observation had stretched over a larger distance. The
later is seen from the time span between the first and last count for
the two points: 1:45h for A vs. 2:45h for B.

```{r,warning=FALSE}
##Make two illustrations
ggplot(counts, aes(x=Time_POSIX, y=Mean, colour=Point)) + geom_line() + xlab("Time") + ylab("Mean of Counts") + geom_point(data=counts_long, aes(x=Time_POSIX, y=Counts)) + facet_wrap(~Point)
```

##  Two On-the-Spot Counting Method

Below we give the mathematical details of the two on-the-spot counting
method. Consider the counting point $X$ of the march, i.e. $X\in
\{A,B\}$. Let $m_X$ be the number of counters at this point. Assume
that the first people of the march pass $X$ at time point $a_X$ and
that the people at the end of the march reach $X$ at time point
$e_X$. The time unit could for example be in minutes. Furthermore,
we counting is such that at regular intervals $c$ counting is
performed for a time block of 1 unit. Let $k_X$ denote the number of
different time points where observations are available. Hence, the
$k_X$ observations at $X$ are
available for the time points $a_X,a_X+c,a_X+2c,a_X+(k_X-1)c$. Denote
by $Y_{X,j}(t)$ the count for period $t$ of the $j$'th person
counting. Then

$$\overline{Y}_X(t) = \frac{1}{m_X} \sum_{i=1}^{m_X} Y_{X,i}(t)$$

is the average of the observer's counts at point $X$ for the time
interval $t$. By scaling up each observer's observation and averaging
over the different observers we get an estimate for the number of
participants at point $X$:

$$ \hat{N}_X = \frac{e_X}{k_X} \sum_{j=1}^{k_X} \overline{Y}_X(a_X +
(j-1)c), \quad X=\{A,B\} $$

In most cases one would have that
$e_X/k_X=c$. In order to adjust the estimate at point $A$ by people
who joined the march after point $A$ we perform an independent
counting at point $B$ and additionally ask $m$ people at point $A$,
whether they marched past point $A$ or not. Denoting $\hat{\phi}$ the
fraction of people answering yes to this question the
**two on-the-spot counting estimator** is
$$
\hat{N} = \hat{N}_A + (1-\hat{\phi}) \hat{N}_B.
$$

A confidence interval based on an asymptotic normal assumption can be
obtained by
$$
\operatorname{se}(\hat{N}) =
\sqrt{\widehat{\operatorname{Var}}(\hat{N}_A) + (1-\hat{\phi})^2
\widehat{\operatorname{Var}}(\hat{N}_B) + \hat{N}_B^2
\frac{\hat{\phi}(1-\hat{\phi})}{m}},
$$
where we have used that
$$
\widehat{\operatorname{Var}}(\hat{N}_X) =
\frac{e_X^2}{k_X^2} \sum_{j=1}^{k_X}
\widehat{\operatorname{Var}}(\overline{Y}_X(a_X + (j-1)c)) =
\frac{e_X^2}{k_X^2} \sum_{j=1}^{k_X}
\frac{\widehat{\operatorname{Var}}(Y_X(a_X + (j-1)c))}{m_X}
$$
and
$$
\widehat{\operatorname{Var}}(Y_X(t)) =
\frac{1}{m_X-1}\sum_{i=1}^{m_X} (Y_{X,i}(t) - \overline{Y}_X(t)).
$$

### Implementation in R

The above equations have been implemented as function `two_on_the_spot_N`
in R, which given a `counts` data.frame computes the estimate and an
corresponding confidence interval. The github code of this post
contains the details.

```{r}
######################################################################
## Function to obtain the two-on-the-spot estimate by Yip et
## al. (2010) for the size of a demonstraion.
##
## Parameters:
##
## @param counts A data.frame containing columns Point, Mean, Var
## @param ccol_regexp Regular expression for specification of the column names containing the counts
## @param phi_estim A vector of length two containing numerator and
## denominator of the survey on how many of the participants asked at

## @param conf.level Confidence level for the returned confidence interval
######################################################################

two_on_the_spot_N <- function(counts,
                              ccol_regexp="^Y[0-9]+",
                              phi_estim, c=5, conf.level=0.95) {

  ##Check that the necessary names are present in the data.frame
  stopifnot(isTRUE(all(!is.na(pmatch(c("Point"), names(counts))))))
  stopifnot(isTRUE(all(!is.na(pmatch(c("A","B"), counts$Point)))))

  ##Add mean and variances to the data frame
  counts <- counts %>%
    mutate(Mean = rowMeans(select(., matches(ccol_regexp)), na.rm = TRUE),
           hatVarY = matrixStats::rowVars(as.matrix(select(., matches(ccol_regexp))), na.rm = TRUE),
           m = matrixStats::rowCounts(!is.na(select(., matches(ccol_regexp))), na.rm = TRUE))

  ##Compute summaries for each point as done in Yip et al. (2010)
  N <- counts %>% group_by(Point) %>% do({
    ##How many observations in total
    k_X <- nrow(.)
    ##Total number of epochs covered. Assumption: Last observation is also extrapolated to become equivalent to c epochs
    tau_X <- 1 + (k_X-1)*c + (c-1)
    ##Compute estimate and its standard error
    Nhat_X <- tau_X / k_X * summarise(., sum(Mean))
    se2_Nhat_X <- tau_X^2 / k_X^2 * summarise(., sum(hatVarY/m))
    ##Return result
    data.frame(Nhat_X=as.numeric(Nhat_X),se2_Nhat_X=as.numeric(se2_Nhat_X))
  })

  ##Compute the phi estimate
  m <- phi_estim[2]
  phi_hat <- phi_estim[1]/phi_estim[2]

  ##Compute the N estimate
  N_hat <- (N %>% filter(Point=="A") %$% Nhat_X) + (1-phi_hat) * (N %>% filter(Point=="B") %$% Nhat_X)

  ##Standard error
  se_N_hat <- sqrt( (N %>% filter(Point=="A") %$% se2_Nhat_X) +
                    (1-phi_hat)^2 * (N %>% filter(Point=="B") %$% se2_Nhat_X) +
                    (N %>% filter(Point=="B") %$% Nhat_X * phi_hat*(1-phi_hat)/m))

  ##95% Confidence interval based on asymptotic normal
  ci <- N_hat + c(ci_lower=-1,ci_upper=1)*qnorm(1-(1-conf.level)/2)* as.numeric( se_N_hat)

  ##Done
  return(list(estimate=N_hat, ci=ci, se_N_hat=se_N_hat, phi_hat=phi_hat))
}
```

We can now use the above data and the additional information that
among 480 interviewed persons at point B, 437 reported to also have
passed point A. In other words $\hat{\phi}$=`r sprintf("%.0f%%",437/480*100)`.

```{r,echo=TRUE}
##Compute the two on the spot estimate based on the data in counts
N <- two_on_the_spot_N(counts, phi_estim=c(437,480),conf.level=0.95)

##Rounded version
with(N, round(c(estimate=estimate,ci)/100)*100)
```

Our estimate for the number of participants of the demonstration is
thus around `r paste0(round(N$estimate/100)*100)` with a 95%
confidence interval of `r paste0(round(N$ci/100)*100,collapse="-")`.
For comparison the author's state that the Hong Kong Police estimate
was around 28000 whereas the organizers claimed a size of 58000.

## Discussion

We were able to reproduce the results of @yip_etal2010 using the
article's data (up to some rounding issues). An R function is now
available for supporting the mobile crowd estimation in the future. It
will be interesting to data synthesize such traditional counting
approaches with more modern data sources such as mobile phone or
twitter data [@botta_etal2015].
