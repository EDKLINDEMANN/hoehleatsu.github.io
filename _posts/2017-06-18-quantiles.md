## Abstract

If your tap water suddenly becomes brown while authorities claim
everything is okay, you start to worry. @langkjaerbain2017 tells the
[Flint Water Crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flint_water_crisis)
story from a statistical viewpoint: essentially the interest is in
whether the 90th percentile in a sample of lead concentration
measurements is above a certain threshold or not. We
illustrate how to perform the necessary calculations with R's quantile
function and show that the type-argument of the function matters.

## Introduction

In a recent [Significance](https://www.significancemagazine.com/) article, @langkjaerbain2017 tells the story about the
[Flint water crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flint_water_crisis). In 2014 the city of Flint, Michigan, USA, decided to change its water
supply to Flint River. Due to insufficient treatment of the water with
corrosion inhibitors the lead concentration in the drinking water
increased, because lead in the aging pipes leached into the water supply. This
created serious health problems - as explained in this [short video summary](https://youtu.be/QnDQFivtCd0). In this blog post we investigate
further the computation of the 90th percentile of the tap water lead
concentration samples described in @langkjaerbain2017.
Quantile estimation in this context has already been discussed in a
recent blog entry entitled
[Quantiles and the Flint water crisis](https://blogs.sas.com/content/iml/2017/05/17/quantiles-flint-water-crisis.html)
by
[Rick Wicklin](https://blogs.sas.com/content/author/rickwicklin/).

The
monitoring of drinking water in the US is regulated by the
[Lead and Copper Rule](https://www.epa.gov/dwreginfo/lead-and-copper-rule)
of the United States Environmental Protection Agency.  The entire text of the rule is
available as electronic code of federal regulation (e-CFR) Title 40:
Protection of Environment,
[Part 141 - National Primary Drinking Water Regulations](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=531617f923c3de2cbf5d12ae4663f56d&mc=true&node=sp40.23.141.i&rgn=div6).
In particular the regulation defines a sampling plan for collecting
tap water samples. The size of the sample depends on the number of
people the water system serves. In case this number is bigger than
100,000 a sample of 100 sites is needed. If there are 10,001-100,000
people served, then a sample from 60 sites is needed. For
systems serving fewer than 10,000 sizes of 40, 20, 10 and 5 are
defined - see [ยง141.86(c)](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=531617f923c3de2cbf5d12ae4663f56d&mc=true&node=sp40.23.141.i&rgn=div6#se40.25.141_186) of the rule for details. Of interest
for this blog post is that action needs to be taken, if too many of the
samples are above a given threshold of 15 part per billion (ppb):

highlighted in yellow.</FONT>
<p>
We note the explicit duality in the CFR between the *in more than 10%* and the 90%
quantile in the text. However, we also note that it is not
clear how to proceed, if the number calculated in (c)(3)(ii) is **not an
integer**. This is not a problem per se, because the CFR itself only
operates with samples sizes 100, 60, 40, 20, 10 and 5, where 0.9 times
the sample size always
gives an integer number. But if one for some reason does not
obtain exactly the required number this quickly can become an issue as
we shall see below.

## The Flint Data

The data of the spring 2015 Flint water supply monitoring conducted by
the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality are presented in the figure on p. 20
of @langkjaerbain2017. Alternatively, they can also be taken directly from the Blog entry
[Quantiles and the Flint water crisis](https://blogs.sas.com/content/iml/2017/05/17/quantiles-flint-water-crisis.html)
by [Rick Wicklin](https://blogs.sas.com/content/author/rickwicklin/).



```r
##Read flint water monitoring data (the column lead is the measurement)
flint <- read.csv(file=file.path(filePath,"flint.csv"))
##Sort the measured lead values in ascending order
lead  <- sort(flint$lead)
##Number of observations
n <- length(lead)
```

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/figure/source/2017-06-18-quantiles/HISTOGRAM-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

The proportion of observations above the 15 ppb threshold is

```r
mean(lead > 15)
```

```
## [1] 0.1126761
```

In other words, the proportion 11.3%
is above the 10% action threshold and, hence, something needs to be
done. However, as @langkjaerbain2017 describes, the story is a little
more complicated, because two of the values above 15 were removed with
the argument that they originated from sites which are not covered by
the sampling plan. Only private households at high
risk, i.e. with lead pipelines, are supposed to be sampled. As one can
read in the article the removal is highly controversial, in particular, because the proportion of critical observations falls
below the 10% action threshold when these two values are removed. For this blog entry, we will, however, work
with the full $n=71$ sample and focus on the **quantile aspect** of the
calculation.

## Percentages and Quantiles

Let $n$ denote the size of the selected sample, which in our case is
$n=71$. If more than 10% of the sample is to be above 15 ppb, this
means that $\lfloor 0.1\cdot n +
1\rfloor$ of the samples need to be above 15 ppb, where $\lfloor y
\rfloor$ denotes the largest integer less than or equal to $y$. We shall denote this
the **number of critical samples**. If we divide this number by $n$ we
get the actual proportion of critical samples needed before action. It
is worthwhile noting the difference between this critical proportion
and the 10% threshold illustrated by the sawtooth curve in the figure
below. The explanation for these sawtooth step-spikes is the discreteness
of the decision problem (i.e. $x$ out of $n$).

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/figure/source/2017-06-18-quantiles/SAWTOOTH-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Turning to the equivalent *90% quantile is above 15 ppm* decision
criterion of the CFR, one will need to determine the 90% quantile from
the finite sample of lead concentration measurements. How to estimate
quantiles with statistical software is discussed in the excellent
survey of @hyndman_fan1996. In their work they describe the nine different
quantile estimators implemented in R's `quantile` function. The
estimators are all based on the
[order statistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_statistic) of
the sample, i.e. let $x_{(1)} \leq x_{(2)} < \cdots \leq x_{(n)}$ denote the
ordered lead concentration measurements. Then the simplest estimator for the $p\cdot 100\%$ quantile is

$$
\hat{x}_p = \min_{k} \left\{\hat{F}(x_{(k)}) \geq p\right\} =
x_{(\lceil n \cdot p\rceil)},
$$



where $\hat{F}$ is the
[empirical cumulative distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_distribution_function)
function of the sample and $\lceil y \rceil$ denotes the smallest
integer greater than or equal to $y$. This method corresponds to R's
`type=1`. For our application $p$ would be 0.9 and the 90th percentile
for the Flint data is thus

```r
c("manual.90%"=lead[ceiling(n*p)], R=quantile(lead, probs=p, type=1))
```

```
## manual.90%      R.90% 
##         18         18
```
which is above the action threshold of 15 ppb. It is also important to note that when
$x_{(\lceil n \cdot 0.9\rceil)} > 15\> \text{ppb}$ then a total $n - \lceil n \cdot 0.9\rceil + 1$
samples are above 15 ppm. In other words the proportion of samples
above 15 ppm in this situation is
$$ \frac{n - \lceil n \cdot 0.9\rceil + 1}{n}.$$
To
show the duality between the *more than 10% critical samples* and the 90%
quantile being above 15 ppm we thus need to show that $(n - \lceil n
\cdot 0.9\rceil + 1)/n = (\lfloor 0.1\cdot n + 1\rfloor)/n$. This is
possible since the following
[relations hold for the floor and ceiling functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_and_ceiling_functions):
$$ \begin{align*}
- \lceil y \rceil &= \lfloor -y \rfloor \quad \text{and} \\
n + \lfloor y \rfloor &= \lfloor n + y \rfloor,
\end{align*}
$$
with $n$ being an integer and $y$ any real number. Thus,
$$
(n+1) - \lceil n \cdot 0.9\rceil = (n+1) + \lfloor -n \cdot 0.9\rfloor =
\lfloor (n+1) -  n \cdot 0.9\rfloor = \lfloor 0.1n+1 \rfloor.
$$

**Important conclusion**: We have thus shown that with the `type=1`
quantile method we have the duality between having more than 10%
critical samples and the 90th percentile of the measurements being
above 15 ppm.

### Other Quantile Types



Since $\hat{F}$ has jumps of size $1/n$ the
actual value of $\hat{F}(\hat{x}_{p})$ can end up being somewhat
larger than the desired $p$. Therefore, @hyndman_fan1996 prefer
estimators interpolating between two adjacent order statistics. Also because such estimators have a lower
mean squared error in most cases [@dielman_etal1994]. As an
example of such an extended estimator, the `type=5` quantile estimator
is defined by letting $h=p n + 1/2$ and then computing:
$$
\hat{x}_p = x_{\lfloor h \rfloor} + (h - \lfloor h \rfloor) (x_{\lfloor h
\rfloor + 1} - x_{\lfloor h \rfloor}).
$$

Doing this either manually or using the `quantile` function
one obtains:

```r
## Small function to manually compute the type=5 p*100th quantile
## for the sample x
manual_quantile_5 <- function(x, p) {
  h <- length(x)*p + 0.5
  x <- sort(x)
  return(x[floor(h)] + (h - floor(h))* (x[floor(h)+1] - x[floor(h)]))
}

c("manual.90%"=manual_quantile_5(lead, p=0.9), R=quantile(lead, probs=0.9,type=5))
```

```
## manual.90%      R.90% 
##       18.8       18.8
```

Instead of reading the above or using the R code one can also instead watch a
more
[didactic whiteboard explanation](https://youtu.be/9pql00zr700) for [Michigan Radio](http://michiganradio.org/post/video-how-dropping-two-flints-lead-test-numbers-changed-things-state)
by Professor
[Christopher Gardiner](http://www.emich.edu/math/faculty/cgardiner.php)
 on how to calculate the 90% quantile
using a `type=5` argument for the Flint sample. However, the important
point of the above calculations is that this quantile type is **of limited interest**, because the Lead and Copper Rule implicitly defines that one has to use the
`type=1` quantile. To make this point even more explicit, we use sampling
with replacement from the Flint data to construct a dataset, where the
90% `type=5`-quantile is above 15 ppm, but the percentage of samples
above the 15 ppm threshold is less than 10%.


```r
##Function to compute the proportion critical as well as the 90% quantile
##using type (type)-quantiles. Returns the quantile as well as the proportion
##above the 15 ppm threshold
prop_critical_and_q90 <- function(x, type=5) {
  q90 <- as.numeric(quantile(x, type=type,probs=p))
  prop <- mean(x>15)
  c(q90=q90,prop= prop)
}

##Make 100 datasets by sampling with replacement
r <- data.frame(seed=seq_len(100)) %>% rowwise %>% do({
  set.seed(.$seed)
  newdata <- sample(lead, replace=TRUE)
  as.data.frame(seed=.$seed, t(prop_critical_and_q90(newdata)))
})

##Check which datasets violate the duality between quantile and
##percentage above threshold assumption
r %<>% mutate(violates_duality =  q90 > 15 & prop < 0.1)

##Do the stats for this dataset
(five <- r %>% filter(violates_duality) %>% slice(1:5))
```

```
## # A tibble: 5 ร 3
##     q90       prop violates_duality
##   <dbl>      <dbl>            <lgl>
## 1  15.0 0.09859155             TRUE
## 2  15.0 0.09859155             TRUE
## 3  16.2 0.09859155             TRUE
## 4  15.0 0.09859155             TRUE
## 5  15.8 0.09859155             TRUE
```

We note that some of the lines in the above output are artifacts of
lacking numerical precision: the quantile is only above 15 due to
numerical imprecision in the calculation of the `type=5` quantile:


```r
print(five$q90, digits=20)
```

```
## [1] 15.000000000000028422 15.000000000000028422 16.200000000000045475
## [4] 15.000000000000028422 15.800000000000039790
```

This shows that regulatory business with
[floating point arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic)
is tricky. As a step towards fixing the problem, one could redefine
the greater and less than operators, respectively, to only compare up to
numerical precision:


```r
##Function to do numerical safe greater than comparision
"%greater%" <- function(x,y) {
  equal_up_to_numerical_precision <- isTRUE(all.equal(x,y))
  return( (x > y) & !(equal_up_to_numerical_precision) )
}

##Function to do numerical safe less than  comparision
"%less%" <- function(x,y) {
  equal_up_to_numerical_precision <- isTRUE(all.equal(x,y))
  return( (x < y) & !(equal_up_to_numerical_precision) )
}

##Add the new column, which does < and > comparisons only up to
##numerical precision
r %<>% mutate(violates_duality_numsafe =  (q90 %greater% 15) & (prop %less% 0.1))

##Show five violation candidates for this corrected dataset
(five <- r %>% filter(violates_duality_numsafe) %>% slice(1:5))
```

```
## # A tibble: 5 ร 4
##     q90       prop violates_duality violates_duality_numsafe
##   <dbl>      <dbl>            <lgl>                    <lgl>
## 1  16.2 0.09859155             TRUE                     TRUE
## 2  15.8 0.09859155             TRUE                     TRUE
## 3  15.8 0.09859155             TRUE                     TRUE

## 5  16.2 0.09859155             TRUE                     TRUE
```




## Discussion

To summarize the findings: The type of quantile estimation used in practice matters. It is not clear what
to do, if $0.9\cdot n$ is not integer in the estimation of the 90% quantile under the Lead
and Copper Rule. For the Flint example the 63'rd sorted
value is
13 which is below threshold, whereas the
64'th value is
18 which is above the threshold. If we use `type=1`
then $\lceil 71\cdot 0.9\rceil=64$ would be the
correct value to take and the 90% quantile of the sample would be estimated to be 18 ppb. This means that the 19 ppb vertical line in
the figure of @langkjaerbain2017 is a little misleading, because this appears to be
the rounded `type=5` quantile.
For the setting with $n=71$ samples, both estimators are although above the action threshold of 15 ppb, so
in the particular Flint application it does not
matter so much which method to take. However, in other settings this
might very well make a difference! So **be careful with the type
argument of the quantile function**. As an example, the nine different types of
R's `quantile` function provide estimates for the 90% quantile in the
range from 17.50 to 19.60 for the Flint data.
The default type argument in R is `type=7`, so if nothing else is specified
when calling the quantile function `type=7` is what you get.

On another note, one can discuss if it is a good idea to rely on the
`type=1` quantile estimator in the rule, because it is well known
that this type does not have as good estimation properties as, e.g.,
`type=5`. However, `type=1` is simpler to compute, **ensures duality**
with the intuitive critical proportion, and has the property that the
obtained value is always one also occurring in the sample. The later
thus avoids the issue of numerical instability.

Finally, the
[blog post](https://blogs.sas.com/content/iml/2017/05/17/quantiles-flint-water-crisis.html)
by Rick Wicklin addresses quantile estimation from an even more
statistical viewpoint by computing confidence intervals for the
quantile - a topic, which has been
[previously treated theoretically](http://staff.math.su.se/hoehle/blog/2016/10/23/quantileCI.html)
in this blog. Compliance to a given quantile
threshold based on samples has also been treated in the entirely different
context of digital elevation models [@hoehle_hoehle2009]. Typically,
tests and the dual confidence intervals are in this regulation setting
formulated in a reversed way, such that one needs to provide enough
evidence to show that underlying 90th percentile is indeed below 15 ppm beyond
reasonable doubt. An interesting question in this context is how large
the sample needs to be in order to do this with a given certainty -
see @hoehle_hoehle2009 for details. It is, however, worthwhile
pointing out that the Lead and Copper Rule does not know about
confidence intervals. Currently, **estimation uncertainty** is only
treated implicitly by specifying sample size as a function of number
of people served by the water system and then hard-thresholding the
result at 15 ppm.

**On a Personal Note**: If you want more details on the use of confidence
intervals for quantiles, join my 5 minute
