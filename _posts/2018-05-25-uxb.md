## Abstract

Unexploded WWII bombs are ticking threats despite being dropped more
than 70 years ago. In this post we explain how statistical methods are
used to plan the search and disposal of unexploded WWII bombs. In
particular we consider and exemplify the non-parametric nearest
neighbour distance (NND) method implemented in the R package
`highriskzone`.  The method analyses the spatial pattern of exploded
bombs to determine so called risk-zones, that is regions with a high
likelihood of containing unexploded bombs. The coverage of such
risk-zones is investigated through both non-parametric and parametric
point process simulation.

## Introduction

During WWII Germany was pounded with about
[1.5 mio tons of bombs](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/seventy-years-world-war-two-thousands-tons-unexploded-bombs-germany-180957680/)
of which about 10-15% did not explode. More than 70 years after the
end of WWII these unexploded bombs (UXBs) still pose a threat and are
the frequent cause of large scale evacuations to secure their
[safe disposal](https://ncap.org.uk/case-studies/explosive-ordnance-disposal)
when found. Luckily, lethal incidents are rare thanks to a huge effort
to
[localise and safely dismantle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrIDT26BAt0)
UXBs. As part of this effort, aerial photos taken by the allies after
the attacks provide valuable information about the possible locations
of UXBs. Some UXBs are directly visible in the photos - see for
example the green circles in this
[NCAP image](https://ncap.org.uk/sites/default/files/NCAP_JARIC_106G_4923_4226_UXO_600.jpg)
or p. 6 in the following
[information flyer](https://www.luftbilddatenbank.de/download/luftbilddatenbank.pdf)
by one of the companies offering such aerial identification services
(featured in this
[news article](http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/firm-uses-historic-aerial-photos-to-find-unexploded-wwii-bombs-a-825836.html)). In
other cases the photos only provide information about the location of
the exploded bombs. This information can be used to identify areas where
there is a high likelihood of UXBs. Such areas would then be carefully
scrutinized using on-the-ground search methods, for example,
electromagnetic and magnetic detectors.

The aim of @mahling_etal2013 was to develop statistical methods for
the identification of such risk-zones in co-operation with
*Oberfinanzdirektion Niedersachsen*, which supports the removal of
unexploded ordnance in federal properties in Germany.  In what follows
we will discuss *one* of the methods used in the paper, the so called
**nearest neighbourhood distance method** and illustrate its
implementation in the R package `highriskzone` originally created by
[Heidi Seibold](http://heidiseibold.github.io) and now maintained by
[Felix Günther](http://www.stablab.stat.uni-muenchen.de/personen/doktoranden/guenther/index.html).

### Mathematical Setup

Casting matters into mathematical notation: Let $X$ be a point
process denoting the spatial locations of all bombs dropped in the
particular window of interest $W \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$. Furthermore,
let $Y$ denote the observed point process of exploded bomb and
$Z=X\backslash Y$ the point process of unexploded bombs. Note that
only the process $Y$ is observed; $Z$ is not observed and the target
of our inference. We assume that the probability $q$ of a dropped bomb
not exploding is homogeneous in $W$. Thus if $X$ is a inhomogeneous
Poisson point process with intensity function $\lambda_X(\bm{s})$,
$\bm{s}\in W$, then

$$
\lambda_Y(\bm{s}) = (1-q) \lambda_X(\bm{s})
\quad \text{and}\quad
\lambda_Z(\bm{s}) = q \lambda_X(\bm{s})
$$

are the intensity functions of $Y$ and $Z$, respectively.

The figure below shows $Y$ for an actual observed WWII bomb point
consisting of n=443 bombs available from the R
package `highriskzone` [@highriskzone]. The observation window
contains a particular area of interest for which a risk assessment
needs to be done - often these contain a known WWII military target,
e.g., an airport, an arms factory or a military casern. In order to
not disclose the exact location of the considered area, coordinates
are given relative to an arbitrary origo. In reality one would closely
link such digitized aerial images to other terrain features using a
GIS system.


```r
library(highriskzone)
library(spatstat)
data(craterA)
summary(craterA)
```

```

The point pattern `craterA` corresponding to an instance of the
process $Y$ is provided in R as an object of class ppp
from the R package `spatstat` [@baddeley_etal2015]. Instead of
inferring the locations in $Z$ directly, we shall be interested in
determining a region within $W$, a so called **high risk zone**, which
with a high likelihood contains the points of $Z$. We shall consider
two methods for this job: a non-parametric method based on nearest
neighbour distances in $Y$ and an intensity function based
inhomogeneous Poisson process approach incorporating $q$.

### High Risk Zones

A heuristic way to determine a high-risk zone is the following:
Determine the distribution function $D$ of the nearest neighbour
distance (NND) distribution based on the 443 points
in the point pattern. Use the distribution to determine a desired
quantile, say $0 \leq p \leq 1$ of the NND distribution. Denoting the
$p$ sample quantile of the NND distribution by $Q(p)$, a $p$-quantile
NND based high-risk zone is then obtained as the union of putting a disc of
radius $x_q$ around each observed exploded bomb in $Y$ - in
mathematical terms:

$$
R_p = \left(\bigcup_{\bm{y} \in Y} B(\bm{y}, Q(p))\right) \bigcap W =
 \left\{\bm{s} \in W : \min_{\bm{y}\in Y} || \bm{s} − \bm{y} || \leq Q_Y(p) \right\},
$$

where $B(\bm{s}, r)$ denotes a disc of radius $r$ around the point
$\bm{s}$ and $||\bm{s} - \bm{y}||$ is the distance between the two points
$\bm{s}$ and $\bm{y}$. The intersection with $W$ is done in order to guarantee
that the risk zone lies entirely within $W$. As an example, we would
determine the 99%-quantile NND zone for `craterA` using `spatstat`
functionality as follows:

```r
(Qp <- quantile(nndist(craterA), p = 0.99, type = 8))
```

```
##      99% 
## 142.1391
```

```r
dmap <- distmap(craterA)
zone_dist <- eval.im( dmap < Qp )
```
The above can also be done directly using `highriskzone::det_hrz` function:

```r
zone_dist <- det_hrz(craterA, type="dist", criterion = "indirect", cutoff=0.99)
```
Either way, the resulting risk-zone is as follows:

```r
summary(zone_dist)
```

```
## high-risk zone of type dist  
## criterion: indirect  
## cutoff: 0.99  
##  
## threshold: 142.1391  
## area of the high-risk zone: 2580654
```
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/figure/source/2018-05-25-uxb/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
@mahling_etal2013 show that risk zones constructed by the NND method
work surprisingly well despite lacking a clear theoretical
justification. One theoretical issue is, for example, that the NND
distribution function determined by the above method is for the
$(1-q)$ thinned process $Y$, even though the actual interest is in the
process $X=Y\cup Z$. Because of the thinning one would typically have
that $D_Y(r) \leq D_X(r)$ and thus $Q_Y(p) > Q_X(p)$. Using $Q_Y(p)$
to make statements about $X$ (and thus $Z$) is therefore slightly
wrong. However, this error cancels, because we then use the points in
$Y$ to add a buffer of radius $Q_Y(p)$. Had we instead used the
smaller, but true, $Q_X(p)$ the risk zone would have gotten a too
small, because $X$ would also have contained more points to form discs
around than $Y$. The method thus implicitly takes $q$
non-parametrically into account, because its NND is determined based
on $Y$ and subsequently discs of radius $Q_Y(p)$ are formed around the
points of $Y$.

<div class = "framedbox">
Technical details you might want to skip: The above feature is most
easily illustrated if $X$ is a
homogeneous Poisson process with intensity $\lambda_X$. In this case
we have that the NND distribution function is [p.68, @illian_etal2008]

$$
D_X(r) = 1 - \exp(-\lambda_X \pi r^2), \quad r>0.
$$

Also note that $D_Y(r) = 1 - \exp(-(1-q)\lambda_X \pi r^2)$ and
therefore $D_Y(r) > D_X(r)$. Now solving for the $p$-quantile of the
NND in this homogeneous Poisson case means solving

$$
Q_Y(p) = \min_{r\geq 0} \{ D_Y(r) \geq p \} \Leftrightarrow Q_Y(p) =
\sqrt{ \frac{\log(1-p)}{\lambda_Y \pi}}.
$$

From this it becomes clear than in the homogeneous Poisson case $Q_
Y(p)$ is a factor $\sqrt{1/(1-q)}$ larger than $Q_X(p)$, which is the
actual target of interest.

### Assessing the coverage of a risk-zone

Two criterion appear immediate in order to assess the coverage of a
risk-zone $R$:

1. The probability $p_{\text{out}}$ that there will be at least one
bomb outside the risk zone, i.e. $P( N( Z \backslash R) > 0)$, where
$N(A)$ denotes the number of events in the set $A \subseteq W$.  Note:
this probability is depending heavily on the amount of points in $Z$,
the more points there are, the higher is $p_{\text{out}}$. However, it
reflects the idea "one miss is all it takes to get in trouble".

2. The proportion of events in $Z$ not located in $R$, i.e. $N( Z
\backslash R) / N(Z)$, we shall denote this criterion by
$p_{\text{miss}}$. Note: This probability is taking possible different
sizes of $Z$ into account, but also takes a more relative approach
towards how many bombs are not covered by the zone.

Under the assumption of independence between whether $Z$-events are within or
outside the risk-zone one can convert back and forth
between $p_{\text{miss}}$ and $p_{\text{out}}$ by

$$
p_{\text{out}} = P( N( Z \backslash R) > 0) = 1- P(N(Z
\backslash R) = 0) \approx  1 - (1-p_{\text{miss}})^{N(Z)},
$$

where one in a simulation setup would know $Z$ and thus also
$N(Z)$. Note that for a $p$-quantile NND risk-zone we expect
$1-p_{\text{miss}}$ to be approximately equal to $p$. We can
investigate the behaviour of risk-zones according to the two above
criterion through the use of simulation. Either by simply $q$-thinning
of the existing point pattern $Y$ and then use this thinned pattern to
determine a risk-zone, which is then evaluated.  An alternative
approach is to estimate the intensity surface from $Y$, upscale it to
get the intensity of $X$, simulate $X$ as an inhomogeneous Poisson
point process with this intensity surface, thin this pattern to get a
simulated instance of $Y$, construct the risk-zone based on this
pattern and then evaluate the coverage of the zone
[@mahling_etal2013]. Note that this type of simulation is based on
more assumptions compared to the non-parametric thinning simulation
approach.

We generate 1,000 realizations of $Y$ and $Z$ through $q$-thinning
of the original `craterA` pattern while computing the coverage
measures for the NND method as follows:


```r
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(doParallel))
registerDoParallel(cores=4)

simulate_method <- "thinning" #"intensity" # "cond_intensity"
sim <- foreach(i=seq_len(getDoParWorkers()), .combine=rbind) %dopar% {
  tryCatch(
    eval_method(craterA, type=c("dist"), criterion=c("indirect"),
                cutoff=0.99, numit = 250, simulate=simulate_method,
                pbar=FALSE),
    error= function(e) return(NULL))
}
```


```
## # A tibble: 1 x 5
##   p_out  p_miss `1-p_miss` p_out_derived    nZ
##   <dbl>   <dbl>      <dbl>         <dbl> <dbl>
## 1 0.097 0.00236      0.998        0.0996  44.4
```

The numbers state the average `p_out` and `p_miss`in the 1000
simulations. Furthermore, `nZ` denotes the average number of events in
$Z$. We see that the NND method performs even a little better
than intended, because $1-p_{\text{miss}}$ is even higher than the
intended $p$=99%. The probability that the risk-zone misses at least one
bomb lies as low as 0.097. This is quite close to the
above described approximate conversion from $p_{\text{miss}}$ (0.100 vs. 0.097). Changing the
simulation method for $X$ to that of an inhomogeneous Poisson process with
intensity $1/(1-q) \cdot \hat{\lambda}_Y(\bm{s})$ yields similar
results:


```
## # A tibble: 1 x 5
##   p_out  p_miss `1-p_miss` p_out_derived    nZ
##   <dbl>   <dbl>      <dbl>         <dbl> <dbl>
## 1 0.352 0.00897      0.991         0.361  49.6
```

We note that the probability of missing at least one bomb is much
higher under this parametric simulation method. Only a small fraction
of this is explained by $Z$ now consisting of more points. A likely
explanation is that the parametric model is only semi-adequate to
describe how the point patterns form. Therefore, the new $X$ might
have a somewhat different neighbourhood distribution than anticipated.



To compare more specifically with the intensity function based
risk-zone method of @mahling_etal2013 we use a specification, where
the risk-zone derived by the NND method or the intensity method have
the same area (250 hectare).




```r
sim_area <- foreach(i=seq_len(getDoParWorkers()), .combine=rbind) %dopar% {
  tryCatch(
    eval_method(craterA, type=c("dist","intens"), criterion=rep("area",2),
                cutoff=rep(2500000,2), numit = 100,
                simulate=simulate_method, pbar=FALSE),
    error= function(e) return(NULL))
}
```


```
## # A tibble: 2 x 6
##   Type   p_out  p_miss `1-p_miss` p_out_derived area_zone
##   <fct>  <dbl>   <dbl>      <dbl>         <dbl>     <dbl>
## 1 dist   0.123 0.00278      0.997         0.117  2500009.
## 2 intens 0.55  0.0172       0.983         0.539  2499994.
```

For the particular example we see an advantage of using the NND
method, because both `p_out` `p_miss` are much lower for the intensity
based method. Again, this might be due to the intensity method being
based on assumptions, which for the particular example do not appear
to be so adequate. Results in @mahling2013 were, however, much better
for this example (c.f. Tab 2), which could be an indication that there
is a problem in the `highriskzone` package implementation of this
method?

## Discussion

Being a statistician is fascinating, because the job is the entry
ticket to so many diverse research fields. The proposed methods and
evaluations helped the *Oberfinanzdirektion* obtain a quantitative
framework to decide which methods to use in their routine
risk-assessment. Further details on the above application can be found
in @mahling_etal2013 as well as in
[Monia's Ph.D. dissertation](https://edoc.ub.uni-muenchen.de/15886/)
[@mahling2013]. Note also that the techniques are not limited to UXB
detection: Infer-unknown-points-from-a-thinned-process problems occur
both in 1D and 2D point processes in a range of other fields, e.g.,
under-reporting of infectious disease locations or in the calculation
of animal abundance in ecology.

As a personal anecdote: When finishing the work on @mahling_etal2013
I was in transition from university to working at a public health
institute. The deal was to finish the UXB work partly in spare-time
and partly in the new work time. To honour this I added my new work
place as second affiliation before submitting, but as part of the
institution's internal clearing procedure of the publication, I was asked
to remove this affiliation again by the higher management, because the
	work 'had nothing to do with public health'. While its questionable
whether exploding bombs really do not have a public health impact, a
few months later, I ended up using very similar statistical techniques to
model occurred-but-not-yet-reported cases during a critical
infectious disease outbreak [@hoehle_anderheiden2014].
