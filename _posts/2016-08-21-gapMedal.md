## Abstract

Following Hans Rosling's gapminder animation style we animate a country's number
of medals won in the olympic summer games as a function of the country's [gross domestic product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product) (GDP) per capita.

# Introduction

Long Swedish winter nights are best spent by watching Hans Rosling's inspiring [TED talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVimVzgtD6w). Such visualizations help the statistician make points about temporal trends, which otherwise might drown in modelling details.
Recently, I stumbled over a blog post on how to use the  `gganimate` R package to animate the Gapminder available from the `gapminder` package. So I got interested in trying to perform a Rosling style animation with R: Today, the olympic summer games end in Rio. As usual this spawns a debate, if the nation's participation has been successful. For this purpose the [olympic medal table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal_table) is preferably taken as basis for comparisons. Recent analyses have been interested in how to correct these tables for, e.g., population size or, more interesting, analyse the influence of GDP.

Aim of this blog note is to visualize how countries develop in the medal table while setting this in relation to their GDP. From a technical viewpoint we use R to scrape the olympic medal tables from Wikipedia and animate the results Gapminder style. **Disclaimer**: We only show the potential of such an analysis and, hence, worry less about the scientific validity of the analysis. 

# Data

We use the data of [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/) in order to obtain country specific population and GDP data for each of the years 1960-2012. These are based on data from the World Bank. The olympic medal tables are harvested from Wikipedia.

## Olympic medal tables

Olympic medal tables were extracted using the `rvest` package from Wikipedia pages using the post by [Cory Nissen](http://blog.corynissen.com/2015/01/using-rvest-to-scrape-html-table.html). These data contain the current state and takes  changes after the games, e.g. due to doping, partly into account. For details see for example the [medal table of the 2012 summer games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Summer_Olympics_medal_table) in London. The scraping functionality is hidden in the function `scrape_medaltab` - see the code on GitHub for details.




```r
#Years which had olympic games
olympic_years <- seq(1960, 2012, by=4)

# Extra olympic medal table from all olympic years since 1960
medals <- bind_rows(lapply(olympic_years, scrape_medaltab))

# Show result
DT::datatable(medals)
```

## Gapminder data

We obtain GDP per capita and population data from [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/data/). Unfortunately, these need to be fetched and merged manually. A more convenient way would have been to take these directly from the package [`gapminder`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gapminder/index.html), but the population is here only available for the years with GDP data and not, as in the original source data, for all years. For simplicity, we hide this data munging code and refer to the underlying code on GitHub for the details.



For convenience, we also extract the corresponding continent each country belongs to. This can be done conveniently by comparing with the `gapminder` dataset (see code for details).





## Joining the two data sources

In principle all that is left to do is to join the two data sources using the names of the gapminder dataset and the nation names of the olympic medal tables. However, this would ignore the fact that there is a discrepancy between the national olympic committees sending the athletes and the countries for which we have GDP information.

A further challenge of the present country based analysis is how to incorporate the many political changes which happened during that period. As an example, East Germany participated as independent national olympic committee during 1968-1988, but the gapminder data only contain GDP data for Germany as a total. A further important change is the split of the former Soviet Union into several independent states. As a consequence, in 1992 the former Soviet republics participated as [Unified Team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Team_at_the_1992_Summer_Olympics). We skip the details of these many data munging details and simply refer to the GitHub code for details.




```r
medals_gm <- left_join(medals_mod, gapminder_manual, by=c("Nation","Year"))
```

# Results

First we analyse the [all-time summer olympic medal table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-time_Olympic_Games_medal_table) for the period 1960-2012.


```r
medals_alltime <- medals_gm  %>% group_by(Nation)  %>% summarise(Total=sum(Total))  %>% arrange(desc(Total))
DT::datatable(medals_alltime)
```

![](http://staff.math.su.se/hoehle/blog/figure/source/2016-08-21-gapMedal/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)

We now plot of the total number of medals awarded for each summer games in the period of 1960-2012.

```r
nTotal <- medals_gm %>% group_by(Year) %>% summarise(TotalOfGames=sum(Total))
ggplot(nTotal, aes(x=Year,y=TotalOfGames)) + geom_line() + ylab("Total number of medals")
```

![](http://staff.math.su.se/hoehle/blog/figure/source/2016-08-21-gapMedal/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)

We observe a clear trend. Hence, in order to make between country comparisons over time based on the number of medals won, we normalize the numbers of medal won using the total number of medals awarded during the  games. We store this result in the column `Frac`.


```r
medals_gm <- medals_gm %>% left_join(nTotal, by="Year") %>% mutate(Frac = Total / TotalOfGames)
```

We now look at the country results for each summer games starting from 1996.

Finally, we can use the `gganimate` package to visualize the dependence of the total number of medals won in the summer games 1960-2012 as a function of GDP per capita. See the [package documentation](https://github.com/dgrtwo/gganimate) for details.

It is worth noticing that China, due to protests against the participation of Taiwan, did not participate in the Olympics 1956-1980.
