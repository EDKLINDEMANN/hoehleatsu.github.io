## Abstract

Judging from recent R-Bloggers posts, it appears that many data
scientists are concerned with scraping data from various media sources
(Wikipedia, twitter, etc.). However, one should be aware that well
structured and high quality datasets are available through state's and
country's bureau of statistics. Increasingly these are offered to the
public through direct database access, e.g., using a REST like API. We
illustrate the usefulness of such an approach by accessing data from
Statistics Sweden.

## Introduction

Scandinavian countries are world-class when it comes to public
registries. So when in need for reliable population data, this is the
place to look. As an example, we access Statistics Sweden data by
their API
using the `pxweb` package developed by
[\@MansMeg](https://twitter.com/MansMeg),
[\@antagomir](https://twitter.com/antagomir) and
[\@LCHansson](https://twitter.com/LCHansson).  Love was the first
speaker at a Stockholm R-Meetup some
[years ago](https://www.meetup.com/StockholmR/events/105738342/),
where I also gave a talk. Funny how such R-Meetups become useful many
years after!


```r
library(pxweb)
```


By browsing the Statistics Sweden (in Swedish: Statistiska
Centralbyrån (SCB)) data using their
[web interface](http://www.scb.se/en/finding-statistics/) one sees
that they have two relevant first name datasets: one containing the
*tilltalsnamn* of newborns for each year during 1998-2016 and one for
the years 2004-2016. **Note**: A
[*tilltalsnamn*](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&u=https%3A%2F%2Fsv.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FTilltalsnamn&edit-text=&act=url)
in Sweden is *the* first name (of several possible first names) by
which a person is usually addressed. About 2/3 of the persons in the
Swedish name registry indicate which of their first names is their
tilltalsnamn. For the remaining persons it is automatically implied
that their tilltalsnamn is the [first of the first names](http://www.scb.se/hitta-statistik/statistik-efter-amne/befolkning/amnesovergripande-statistik/namnstatistik/produktrelaterat/Fordjupad-information/fragor-och-svar-om-namnstatistiken/#fem).
**Also note:** For reasons of data protection the 1998-2016 dataset
contains only first names used 10 or more times in a given year, the
2004-2016 dataset contains only first names used 2 or more times in a
given year.


Downloading such data through the SCB web-interface is cumbersome,
because the downloads are limited to 50,000 data cells per
query. Hence, one has to do several manual queries to get hold of the
relevant data. This is where their
[API](http://www.scb.se/en_/About-us/Open-data-API/API-for-the-Statistical-Database-/)
becomes a real time-saver. Instead of trying to fiddle with the API
directly using `rjson` or `RJSONIO` we use the specially designed
`pxweb` package to fetch the data.  One can either use the
web-interface to determine the name of the desired data matrix to
query or navigate directly through the api using `pxweb`:

```r
d <- interactive_pxweb(api = "api.scb.se", version = "v1", lang = "en")
```

and select *Population* followed by *Name statistics* and then
`BE0001T04Ar` or `BE0001T04BAr`, respectively, in order to obtain the
relevant data and api download url.

#### Downloading the first name data with `pxweb`

This leads to the following R code for download:


```r
names10 <- get_pxweb_data(
  url = "http://api.scb.se/OV0104/v1/doris/en/ssd/BE/BE0001/BE0001T04Ar",
  dims = list(Tilltalsnamn = c('*'),
              ContentsCode = c('BE0001AH'),
              Tid = c('*')),
  clean = TRUE) %>% as.tbl
```

For better usability we rename the columns a little and
replace `NA` counts to be zero. For visualization we pick 5 random
lines of the dataset.


```r
names10 <- names10 %>% select(-observations) %>%
  rename(firstname=`first name normally used`,counts=values) %>%
  mutate(counts = ifelse(is.na(counts),0,counts))
##Look at 5 random lines
names10 %>% slice(sample(seq_len(nrow(names10)),size=5))
```

```
## # A tibble: 5 × 3
##   firstname   year counts
##      <fctr> <fctr>  <dbl>
## 1     Livia   1998      0
## 2   Elicia    2010     21
## 3     Amie    2000      0
## 4    Albert   2011    108
## 5       Kim   2008     14
```

Note: Each spelling variant of a name in the data is treated as a
unique name. In similar fashion we download the `BE0001AL` dataset as `names2`.


#### Imputing first names with only one use

Since the `names2` dataset contains all first names with 2 or more uses in a
given year it is possible to deduce how many first names are used only
once by subtracting the total number of names in `names2` from the
total number of live births per year.


```r
##Total number of newborns in the data per year
names2_year <- names2 %>% group_by(year) %>% summarise(names=sum(counts))

##Fetch number of live births per year from the corresponding data set
births <- get_pxweb_data(
  url = "http://api.scb.se/OV0104/v1/doris/en/ssd/BE/BE0101/BE0101H/FoddaK",
  dims = list(Region = c('00'),
              AlderModer = c('tot'),
              Kon = c('*'),
              ContentsCode = c('BE0101E2'),
              Tid = c('*')), clean = TRUE)
##Aggregate per year
births_year <- births %>% group_by(year) %>% summarise(births=sum(values))

##Join and compute difference, which is the number of names used exactly once.
(names_join <- inner_join(names2_year, births_year, by="year") %>%
  mutate(nNames1=births-names, propNames1=nNames1/births))
```

```
## # A tibble: 13 × 5
##     year  names births nNames1  propNames1
##    <chr>  <dbl>  <dbl>   <dbl>       <dbl>
## 1   2004  99958 100928     970 0.009610812

```

We notice that the proportion of names occurring exactly once increases
substantially over the years - going from 1.0% in 2004 to 8.4% in 2016. It's not clear if
the imputation by subtraction is 100% exact, but it does
sound plausible that names have become more unique.

#### Merging it all

Based on the above we can create a `data.frame` containing the correct
number of names used once.


```r
missing1names <- names_join %>% group_by(year) %>% do({
  data.frame(firstname=paste0("Uniquename",.$year,"-",sprintf("%.5d",seq_len(.$nNames1))),year=.$year,counts=1L)
}) %>% ungroup
```

We now join the three datasets into one large `data.frame` by

```r
names <- rbind(data.frame(names10,type="min10"),
               data.frame(names2,type="min02"),
               data.frame(rbind(names2,missing1names),type="min01")) %>% as.tbl
```

#### Collision probabilities

We thus got everything in place to compute the name collision
probability over time using the `birthdayproblem` package (as shown in
[previous posts](http://staff.math.su.se/hoehle/blog/2017/02/13/bday.html)).


```r
library(birthdayproblem)
collision <- names %>% group_by(year,type) %>% do({
  data.frame(p=pbirthday_up(n=26L, prob= .$counts / sum(.$counts),method="mase1992")$prob, gini= ineq::Gini(.$counts))
}) %>% ungroup %>% mutate(year=as.numeric(as.character(year)))
```

And the resulting probabilities based on the three datasets `min02`
(at least two instances of the name in a given year), `min10` (at
least ten instances of the name in a given year) and the complete
dataset `min01` can easily be visualized over time.


```r
ggplot( collision, aes(x=year, y=p, color=type)) + geom_line(size=1.5) +
  scale_y_continuous(label=scales::percent,limits=c(0,1)) +
  xlab("Year") + ylab("Probability") +
  ggtitle("Probability of a name collision in a class of 26 kids born in year YYYY") +
  scale_colour_discrete(name = "Dataset")
```

As seen in similar plots for other countries, there is a decline in
the collision probability over time. Note also that the two curves are
upper limits to the true collision probabilities. The true
probabilities, i.e. taking all tilltalsnamn into account, have been
computed based on the `min01` data set, which has been
created by finding the difference between the total number of live
births in a year and the total number of names in `names2`.


## Summary

With all due respect for the need to anonymise the name statistics,
it's hard to understand why the summary figures of how many names with
less than X uses, which have been removed due to privacy concerns, are
not automatically reported. This would allow one to immediately
compute correct totals and collision probabilities. The same problem
occurs, e.g., in the corresponding
[UK and Wales data](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/livebirths/datasets/babynamesenglandandwalesbabynamesstatisticsboys). Here,
Table 6 is listing all first names with 3 or more uses, but not
stating how many newborns have a name occurring once and twice,
respectively.

Luckily, the missing number could be obtained for the Swedish data with a bit
of data dancing and a simple subtraction. Based on these data the collision probabilities are - opposite to some of my
[previous blog analyses](http://staff.math.su.se/hoehle/blog/2017/02/13/bday.html) -
exact. Have a look at the
[SCB data website](http://www.scb.se/en/finding-statistics/), maybe
the data you are looking for can be found here!
