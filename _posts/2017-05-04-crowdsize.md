## Abstract

Inspired by the recent **March For Science** we look into methods for
the statistical estimation of the number of people participating in a
demonstration organized as a march.  In particular, we provide R code
to reproduce the **two on-the-spot counting method** analysis of
@yip_etal2010 for the data of the July 1 March in Hong Kong 2006.

## Introduction

Exercising your democratic right to express support for a cause by
demonstration has found anew usage.  The
[March for Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_for_Science)
is a recent examples of such a demonstration inspired by recent
political developments. The number of persons participating in such
marches is *the* indicator by which the support of the cause is
measured. Crowd size estimates have therefore always been subject to
political interpretation and, hence, possible politically motivated
bias. In this work we focus on what statistics has to offer with
respect to finding the **true number** of participants. A good
overview of this task's challenges is given in @watson_yip2011. A
particular difficulty is the size estimation of moving crowds as seen
in marches.

As case study we replicate the analysis of @yip_etal2010 on estimating
the number of participants in the
[1st of July Marches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_1_July_marches#2006)
in Hong Kong. Since the handover to China in 1997 these marches have
been conducted yearly to demonstrate for democracy and freedom of
speech in Hong Kong. Below is shown the 3.6 km long demonstration
route from
[Victoria Park](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Park_(Hongkong))
to Government Headquarters for the 2006 demonstration as described by
@yip_etal2010. A
[youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WQ2TAEquxM) of the
2006 demonstration illustrates this better than words.

<p>

In order to estimate the number of participants a **two on-the-spot
counting method** was devised by @yip_etal2010: Two points along the
march were selected as shown in the above map: Point A denotes the
location after which an individual is counted as being part of the
march. In order to take into account that people join the march at a
later point than A, a second point B is selected to adjust the count
at A for such late entries. Three to four persons were stationed at
each of the two counting locations. Once the demonstration passed the
respective point each of them started to count the number of people
passing in a one-minute intervals. They counted for one minute every 5
minutes until the last person of the march had passed the counting
point.

### Loading the Data

We store the resulting counting data displayed in Table 2 and Table 3
of @yip_etal2010 as two Excel-files. In a data pre-processing step
these are then read and combined into one data.frame containing the
columns `Y1`-`Y4`. Furthermore, we re-format the table's time
specification to proper POSIX formatted date-times. The exact data
dancing steps can be found in the accompanying
[Rmd code of this post](https://github.com/hoehleatsu/hoehleatsu.github.io/blob/master/_source/2017-05-04-crowdsize.Rmd). Altogether,
this yields a `tbl` with the first couple of lines looking as follows:


```
## # A tibble: 6 Ã— 7
##      Y1    Y2    Y3    Y4     Mean Point          Time_POSIX
##   <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>    <dbl> <chr>              <dttm>
## 1   150    NA   160   180 163.3333     A 2006-07-01 15:55:00
## 2   308   360   250   280 299.5000     A 2006-07-01 16:00:00
## 3   430   350   300   270 337.5000     A 2006-07-01 16:05:00
## 4   210   280   240   252 245.5000     A 2006-07-01 16:10:00
## 5   130   216   200   180 181.5000     A 2006-07-01 16:15:00
## 6   210   260   300   280 262.5000     A 2006-07-01 16:20:00
```

We then compute a number of row-wise statistics for all columns
containing the counts - which columns contain the counts is specified
by a regular expression `ccol_regexp`. In our case would be
`"^Y[0-9]+"`.



### Descriptive Statistics



The counts of the 4
counters at point A and the 3 counters at point B are summarized in the following small
table:

<center>
<!-- html table generated in R 3.3.3 by xtable 1.8-2 package -->
<!-- Thu May  4 22:10:26 2017 -->
<table border=1, padding=10, style="width=80%">
<tr> <th> Point </th> <th> n_counters </th> <th> n_timepoints </th> <th> sum_of_the_mean_counts </th>  </tr>
  <tr> <td> A </td> <td align="right">   4 </td> <td align="right">  22 </td> <td align="right"> 4849.50 </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> B </td> <td align="right">   3 </td> <td align="right">  26 </td> <td align="right"> 4746.67 </td> </tr>
   </table>
</center>
<p>

A time series for the individual counts as well as their mean is shown
below. One observes that at point B the intensity of the crowd was
lower, as the observation had stretched over a larger distance. The
later is seen from the time span between the first and last count for
the two points: approximately 1:45h for A vs. 2:45h for B.

##  Two On-the-Spot Counting Method

Below we give the mathematical details of the two on-the-spot counting
method. Consider the counting point $X$ of the march, i.e. $X\in
\{A,B\}$. Let $m_X$ be the number of counters at this point. Assume
that the first people of the march pass $X$ at time point $a_X$ and
that last people of the march reach $X$ at time point $e_X$. The time
unit could for example be minutes. Counting is done such that at
regular intervals $c$ one counts all people passing the point of
observation within a time block of 1 unit - say 1 minute. Let $k_X$
denote the number of time points where observations are
available at $X$. Hence, the $k_X$ observations at $X$ are available for the
time points $a_X,a_X+c,a_X+2c,a_X+(k_X-1)c$. Denote by $Y_{X,i}(t)$
the $i$'th person's count at time $t$. Then

$$\overline{Y}_X(t) = \frac{1}{m_X} \sum_{i=1}^{m_X} Y_{X,i}(t)$$

is the average of the observer's counts at point $X$ for time $t$. By
scaling up each observer's observations to account for the time blocks
without a count and averaging over the different observers we get an
estimate for the number of participants at point $X$:

$$ \hat{N}_X = \frac{e_X}{k_X} \sum_{j=1}^{k_X} \overline{Y}_X(a_X +
(j-1)c).$$

In most cases one would have that
$e_X/k_X=c$. As an example: If a counter thus counts 200 people for *every*
1-minute-counting-block during two-hours, i.e. corresponding to 24
observations - one every five minutes, her estimate for $N_X$
would be 200$\cdot$ 24$\cdot$ 5= 24000.

In order to adjust the estimate at point $A$ for people
who joined the march after point $A$, we perform an independent
counting at point $B$ and additionally ask $m$ people at point $A$,
whether they marched past point $A$ or not. Denoting $\hat{\phi}$ the
fraction of people answering yes to this question the
**two on-the-spot counting estimator** is
$$
\hat{N} = \hat{N}_A + (1-\hat{\phi}) \hat{N}_B.
$$
Note that this estimator does not take into account that people could
potentially leave the march between $A$ and $B$ and that its
also possible to join the march after $B$. However, the proportion of
such participants is assumed to be negligible.

A confidence interval (CI) based on an asymptotic normal assumption can be
obtained by deriving that
$$
\operatorname{se}(\hat{N}) =
\sqrt{\widehat{\operatorname{Var}}(\hat{N}_A) + (1-\hat{\phi})^2
\widehat{\operatorname{Var}}(\hat{N}_B) + \hat{N}_B^2
\frac{\hat{\phi}(1-\hat{\phi})}{m}},
$$
where we have used that
$$
\widehat{\operatorname{Var}}(\hat{N}_X) =
\frac{e_X^2}{k_X^2} \sum_{j=1}^{k_X}
\widehat{\operatorname{Var}}(\overline{Y}_X(a_X + (j-1)c)) =
\frac{e_X^2}{k_X^2} \sum_{j=1}^{k_X}
\frac{\widehat{\operatorname{Var}}(Y_X(a_X + (j-1)c))}{m_X}
$$
and
$$
\widehat{\operatorname{Var}}(Y_X(t)) =
\frac{1}{m_X-1}\sum_{i=1}^{m_X} (Y_{X,i}(t) - \overline{Y}_X(t)).
$$

A two-sided $(1-\alpha)\cdot 100\%$ CI is then constructed as $\hat{N}
\pm z_{1-\alpha/2} \operatorname{se}(\hat{N})$, where $z_{1-\alpha/2}$
is the $1-\alpha/2$ quantile of the standard normal distribution. To
get a 95% CI the value is $z_{1-0.05/2}=1.96$.  Since $N$ is expected to
be at least of moderate size before one bothers counting this
asymptotic CI should have decent coverage.

### Implementation in R

The above equations have been implemented as function
`two_on_the_spot_N` in R, which given a `counts` data.frame computes
the estimate and a corresponding confidence interval. The
[github code of this post](https://github.com/hoehleatsu/hoehleatsu.github.io/blob/master/_source/2017-05-04-crowdsize.Rmd)
contains the details.



```r
args(two_on_the_spot_N)
```

```
## function (counts, ccol_regexp = "^Y[0-9]+", phi_estim, c = 5, 
##     conf.level = 0.95) 
## NULL
```

Among 480 interviewed persons at point B, 437 reported to also have
passed point A. In other words $\hat{\phi}$=91% and we obtain $\hat{N}$ as follows with R:


```r
##Compute the two on the spot estimate based on the data in counts
N <- two_on_the_spot_N(counts, phi_estim=c(437,480),conf.level=0.95)

##Rounded version
with(N, round(c(estimate=estimate,ci)/100)*100)
```

```
## estimate ci_lower ci_upper 
##    26400    25600    27200
```

Our estimate for the number of participants is thus around
26400 with a 95% confidence interval of
25600-27200.  For comparison the
authors state that the Hong Kong Police's estimate was around 28000,
whereas the organizers claimed a size of 58000.

## Discussion

We were able to reproduce the results of @yip_etal2010 using the
article's data (up to some rounding issues). An R function is now
available for supporting mobile crowd estimation in the future. It
will be interesting to synthesize the traditional and easy to
implement counting approach described above with more modern data
sources such as mobile phone or twitter data [@botta_etal2015].
